## Welcome

CybeDefend is an advanced API designed for application security analysis. Built on a microservices architecture using TypeScript and NestJS and ensuring seamless service communication via Kafka, it provides a robust solution for managing users, organizations, and projects. With OAuth 2.0 authentication and granular permission management based on REBAC, CybeDefend excels in static, dynamic, and IaC security analyses (SAST, DAST, IaC, etc.) by integrating various open source tools.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are secured using Bearer tokens, as defined in the specification:

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
