Cybe AutoFix is CybeDefend's AI agent that automatically generates intelligent, context-aware fixes for detected vulnerabilities and creates pull requests in your repository.

---

## How Cybe AutoFix Works

Cybe AutoFix leverages our proprietary **knowledge graph** to understand the full context of each vulnerability before generating a fix. Unlike traditional autofix tools that apply generic patches, Cybe AutoFix:

- Analyzes the vulnerability's root cause
- Understands how the fix impacts surrounding code
- Ensures fixes maintain code quality and architectural patterns
- Generates production-ready, developer-friendly code
