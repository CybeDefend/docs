Cybe Analysis is CybeDefend's autonomous AI agent that analyzes vulnerabilities with senior-level expertise, eliminates false positives, and provides deep contextual security insights.

## How Cybe Analysis Works

### 1. Code Parsing & Knowledge Graph

When you enable Cybe Analysis, CybeDefend parses your entire codebase into a proprietary **knowledge graph**. This graph captures:

- Code structure and relationships
- Data flows between functions and files
- Dependencies and their usages
- Business logic patterns

This knowledge graph becomes the foundation for all AI-powered analysis.

### 2. AI Agent Analysis

Using custom tools built specifically to interact with the knowledge graph, the Cybe AI agent:

- Analyzes detected vulnerabilities in full context
- Traces data flows to determine real exploitability
- Evaluates business impact based on code usage
- Provides expert-level assessments and recommendations

## Configuration

### Enable Cybe Analysis

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/agent-ai/cybe-analysis-enabled.png" alt="Enable Cybe Analysis in Project Settings" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

1. Navigate to **Project Settings**
2. Find the **Cybe Analysis** section
3. Toggle **Enable Cybe Analysis**
4. Save your settings

<Warning>
Enabling Cybe Analysis requires code parsing, which stores your code in your selected sovereign cloud (EU or US) to ensure zero hallucinations and optimal performance.
</Warning>

### Select Vulnerability Groups

</Frame>

For **SAST scanning**, you can select specific vulnerability groups to analyze:

- SQL Injection
- LDAP Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Path Traversal
- Command Injection
- And more...

**Why selective scanning?** This allows you to focus on vulnerabilities relevant to your application and optimize analysis time.

## Using Cybe Analysis

### Automatic Vulnerability Analysis

Once configured, Cybe Analysis automatically:

1. **Scans selected vulnerability groups** when a scan is triggered
2. **Analyzes each finding** using the knowledge graph for context
3. **Adds detailed comments** to vulnerabilities like a security expert would
4. **Updates vulnerability status** (confirmed, false positive, etc.)

### Priority Assignment

If **vulnerability triage** is enabled in settings:

- Cybe Analysis assigns **priority levels** (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Prioritization considers:
  - Exploitability in your specific context
  - Data sensitivity
  - Exposure to external inputs
  - Business impact

---

## Understanding the Results

### Vulnerability Comments

Each analyzed vulnerability receives a comment from Cybe

## Requirements

- Project must be created in CybeDefend
- Code parsing must be enabled (automatic when Cybe Analysis is enabled)
- SAST scanner must be enabled for the project
- Sufficient Cybe Analysis credits in your subscription
