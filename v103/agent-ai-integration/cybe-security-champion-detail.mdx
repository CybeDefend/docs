## What is a Security Champion?

In traditional organizations, a **Security Champion** is a designated expert—typically a senior developer with security expertise—who serves as the bridge between development teams and security departments.

### The Traditional Challenge

Human Security Champions face limitations:

- **Limited Availability**: One person covering multiple teams
- **Knowledge Bottlenecks**: Development slows when unavailable
- **Scaling Issues**: Can't maintain recommended 1:10 ratio as teams grow
- **Timezone Gaps**: Not available 24/7

### The Cybe Solution

Cybe Security Champion gives **every developer** their own AI security expert:

- **24/7 Availability**: Always ready to help
- **Instant Responses**: No waiting in queue
- **Unlimited Capacity**: Serves all developers simultaneously
- **Consistent Expertise**: Same level of guidance for everyone

## How It Works

### Knowledge Graph Foundation

Cybe Security Champion leverages our proprietary **knowledge graph** created from your parsed codebase. This enables:

- **Full codebase understanding**: Knows your architecture, dependencies, and patterns
- **Context-aware responses**: Answers specific to your code, not generic advice
- **Accurate analysis**: Zero hallucinations thanks to stored code context

<Warning>
**Code is stored in your selected sovereign cloud** (EU or US) to enable these capabilities. This ensures zero hallucinations and optimal performance while maintaining strict data residency.
</Warning>

## Configuration

### Requirements

<Warning>
**Cybe Security Champion requires**:
- **Cybe Analysis must be enabled** (for code parsing and knowledge graph)
- Project must be scanned at least once
- Code is stored in your sovereign cloud region if security champion's option is enabled
</Warning>

</Frame>

Click the **chat icon** on any vulnerability to:

- Ask about exploitation scenarios
- Understand the vulnerability's context in your code
- Get remediation suggestions specific to your architecture
- Learn why this vulnerability exists and how to prevent it

**Example questions:**
- "How can this SQL injection be exploited in our application?"
- "What's the business impact if this vulnerability is exploited?"
- "Show me the data flow that leads to this XSS issue"

### Chat with Your Codebase

Open the general **Cybe Security Champion chat** to:

- Ask questions about your application's security posture
- Find specific security patterns in your code
- Understand how different components interact
- Get security recommendations for new features

**Example questions:**
- "Where are we validating user input in the authentication flow?"
- "Show me all database queries that use user-supplied data"
- "What security best practices should I follow for our payment module?"
