## 2. Install & Authorize CybeDefend on GitHub

When GitHub prompts you to install the **CybeDefend GitHub App**:

1. **Choose Repositories**  
   Select either all or specific repositories to grant CybeDefend read access.  
2. **Confirm Permissions**  
   We need at least read access for scanning. Write access is optional but enables advanced features like **Auto-Fix PRs** (coming soon).
3. **Complete Installation**  
   Wait a few seconds for GitHub to finalize authorization.

<Tip>
If you have organizational policies restricting third-party app installations, contact your GitHub Org Admin to approve CybeDefend’s GitHub App.
</Tip>

## 3. Linking Repositories to Your Projects

After installation, you can associate any authorized repository with a **new project** in CybeDefend:

- **Go to "Create Project"**: Navigate to [Create Project](/v103/get-started/project-management/create-project).  
- **Select "Continue with GitHub"**: Your authorized repos will appear in a dropdown.  
- **Choose Your Repo**: Pick a repository, assign it to a team, and configure scanning parameters.

<Note>
If you just installed the app, it may take a few moments before your repositories become visible in the "Create Project" flow.
