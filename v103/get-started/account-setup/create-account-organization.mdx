CybeDefend simplifies onboarding by allowing you to create an account through **OAuth2** (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, or GitLab). After signing in, you can form an **Organization** to group your projects and manage access. Once your repositories are connected, CybeDefend automatically starts scanning them.

---

## 1. Create an Account via OAuth2

1. **Go to the CybeDefend Registration Page**  
   Choose the sign-up option of your choice (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, GitLab).

2. **Select Your Cloud Region**  
   CybeDefend offers two sovereign cloud options to meet your compliance and performance needs:

       **Optimized for low latency in North America**
       
       <Frame>
         <img src="/images/get-started/setting-up-account/create-account-step-usa.png" alt="Select US Cloud" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
       </Frame>
       
       **Certifications & Compliance:**
       - SOC 2
       - ISO 27001/17/18
       - ISO 27701
       - HIPAA
       - PCI-DSS
       
       <Note>
       Choose United States for lowest latency in North America.
       </Note>
     </Tab>
   </Tabs>
   
   <Info>
   Your region selection binds IAM/Gateway endpoints at runtime. Deep links are preserved during region switching, and you can change regions later if needed.
   </Info>

3. **Authorize Your Credentials**  
   OAuth2 ensures a secure handshake without requiring you to store new passwords.

4. **Complete Your Profile**  
   Provide your name and agree to our Terms of Service to finalize your account creation.

<Tip>
Already have an existing OAuth provider account? The sign-up process is near-instant.

### Security Fundamentals

All CybeDefend cloud regions implement enterprise-grade security:

- **TLS 1.3** — In-transit encryption
- **Encryption at rest** — All data encrypted at storage layer
- **OAuth2** — Secure authentication without password storage
- **Region-scoped endpoints** — Data residency guarantees

## 2. Create Your Organization

1. **Access the Form**  
   After your first login, you’ll be prompted to create an **Organization**. Alternatively, visit **Organization Settings** → **New Organization**.
2. **Fill in Details**  
   Provide an organization name, an optional description, and (if needed) a logo.
3. **Save & Continue**  
   This sets up your top-level group where teams and projects will live.

<Note>
You can create multiple organizations if you manage different companies, clients, or environments.

## 3. Connect Your Repositories

1. **Select Your Version Control Platform**  
   CybeDefend supports GitHub. Check out our [Detailed Integration Guides](/v103/get-started/connect-your-source-code/connect-github) for each platform.
2. **Authorize Access**  
   Approve read (and optionally write) permissions so we can scan your code.
3. **Pick Your Repositories**  
   Choose which repos to include in your **Organization**. You can assign them to specific teams or projects later.
4. **Instant Scanning**  
   As soon as you connect a repository, CybeDefend triggers an initial scan, identifying potential vulnerabilities.

<Tip>
Once your repositories are connected, scans start automatically—no extra steps required.
