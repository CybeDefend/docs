## Explore CybeDefend

### What is CybeDefend?

CybeDefend is a revolutionary SaaS cybersecurity platform designed to protect business applications against cyberattacks. By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence, our solution not only detects vulnerabilities but also analyzes them intelligently, eliminates false positives, and prioritizes real threats—ensuring robust security accessible to businesses of every size.

### Motivation

Our journey began with firsthand experiences of cyberattacks and the costly rework that follows when vulnerabilities are detected too late. With CybeDefend, security is embedded at the very beginning of the development cycle—not as an afterthought. This proactive approach prevents the need to reverse entire development loops and fixes vulnerabilities early, saving both time and resources.


### With CybeDefend, You Can

- **Secure Your Digital Assets:** Protect your applications and data from evolving cyber threats from the very first line of code.
- **Automate Vulnerability Management:** Leverage AI to reduce false positives and streamline remediation.
- **Gain a Unified View:** Access a single, integrated dashboard that combines all the standard security tools (SAST, DAST, SCA, etc.) with our innovative new features.
- **Innovate Beyond the Norm:** Not only do we provide all the tools that our competitors offer, but we also push the envelope by introducing BLSA—a revolutionary new scanner that sets a new industry standard.
- **Choose your sovereignty and platform:** Select either a European or US infrastructure to ensure optimal latency and secure storage of your analyses, tailored to your geolocation and regulatory requirements.

## Evolution and Innovation: Introducing BLSA

### What is BLSA?

BLSA (Business Logic Security Analysis) is our innovative, next-generation scanner that uses AI agents to detect vulnerabilities in business logic—ensuring security by design from the outset. This breakthrough tool:
- **Detects Business Logic Flaws:** Uncovers vulnerabilities in the fundamental design of your applications that traditional scanners often miss.
- **Utilizes AI Agents:** Leverages intelligent agents to continuously monitor and analyze application logic for potential security risks.
- **Ensures Security by Design:** Integrates security measures early in the development process, preventing costly rework later on.
- **Complements Traditional Tools:** Works seamlessly alongside SAST, DAST, and SCA, providing a comprehensive 360° view of your security posture.
