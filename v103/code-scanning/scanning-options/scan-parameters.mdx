## Scanner Types

CybeDefend supports multiple security scanning methods. Enable the scanners that match your project needs:

### SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

Analyzes source code for security vulnerabilities before runtime.

### SCA (Software Composition Analysis)

Inspects open-source dependencies and libraries for known vulnerabilities.

### IaC (Infrastructure as Code)

Detects misconfigurations in infrastructure definitions (Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.).

### Container

Scans container images for vulnerabilities in base images, packages, and configurations.

<Tip>
We recommend **enabling all scanners** for comprehensive security coverage across your entire stack.

## Vulnerability Severity Levels

Select which **severity levels** to include in your scan results:

- **Critical**: Immediate security risks requiring urgent action
- **High**: Serious vulnerabilities that should be prioritized
- **Medium**: Moderate security issues to address
- **Low**: Minor vulnerabilities or potential improvements

Unchecked severity levels will not appear in your results, allowing you to focus on the most critical findings.

<Note>
This setting filters scan results only—it does not impact scanning time or depth.

## SAST Fast Scanning

Enable **Fast Scan** for quicker SAST results during development:

</Frame>

**Fast Scan characteristics:**
- Uses a subset of SAST scanners
- Reduces scan time significantly
- May detect fewer vulnerabilities (some deep analysis is skipped)
- Only applicable when SAST is enabled

<Warning>
Fast scanning is ideal for **rapid feedback during development**. For production releases or comprehensive audits, use the **full SAST scan**.
</Warning>

## AI-Powered Features

For advanced vulnerability analysis and remediation, CybeDefend offers AI agent features that can be enabled in project settings:

- **Cybe Analysis**: Intelligent false positive detection and vulnerability triage
- **Cybe AutoFix**: Automated fix generation with pull/merge requests
- **Cybe Security Champion**: Interactive security guidance and chatbot

## Saving Your Configuration

After adjusting scan parameters:

1. **Save your settings** in the project configuration
2. **Trigger a new scan** manually or wait for automatic scanning
3. **Review results** in your project dashboard

<Tip>
Balance **scan coverage** and **speed** based on your development stage. Use fast scanning for rapid iterations, and comprehensive scanning for releases.
