## What is Cybe AutoFix?

Traditional autofix solutions apply band-aid fixes without understanding the broader context. Cybe AutoFix revolutionizes remediation by leveraging our proprietary knowledge graph to comprehend the full scope of each vulnerability, ensuring fixes are not only secure but also maintain code quality, performance, and architectural integrity.

## Advanced Remediation Features

### Context-Aware Remediation

Performs deep contextual analysis using knowledge graph technology. Understands the vulnerability's root cause, its propagation through the codebase, and potential side effects of remediation.

### Intelligent Code Generation

Generates production-ready code that follows your team's coding standards, maintains consistency with existing patterns, and preserves business logic while eliminating vulnerabilities.

### Multi-File Coherent Fixes

When vulnerabilities span multiple files, Cybe AutoFix orchestrates coherent modifications across your entire codebase, ensuring all related components are properly updated and synchronized.

### Automated Pull Request Generation

Seamlessly integrates with GitHub and GitLab by automatically creating detailed pull requests. Each PR includes comprehensive documentation explaining the vulnerability, the fix approach, and architectural considerations.

### Regression Prevention

By understanding the complete codebase through our knowledge graph, Cybe AutoFix ensures fixes don't introduce new vulnerabilities or break existing functionality.
