Integrate CybeDefend's security platform directly into your AI-powered IDE with our **MCP Server**—a secure-by-design companion for AI code assistants.

---

## What is the CybeDefend MCP Server?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** plugs your favorite LLM (Cursor, Claude, VS Code Copilot Chat, Windsurf, etc.) into the CybeDefend platform, enabling your AI assistant to access vulnerability data and provide security guidance directly within your IDE.

---

## Key Benefits

| Benefit | What it enables |
|---------|----------------|
| **Direct Vulnerability Access** | Fetch SAST, IaC, and SCA findings using your project ID |
| **In-IDE Remediation** | Jump to exact file/line with code snippets for inline fixes |
| **Always Up-to-Date** | Pull latest results and statuses as scans complete |
| **Zero-Setup** | One command, no local API proxies, pure STDIO |

<Note>
All endpoints are thin wrappers around CybeDefend's REST API—no data is stored locally.
</Note>

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node ≥ 18
- A CybeDefend API key with project-level access

### Install Globally (Optional)

```bash
npm i -g @cybedefend/mcp-server
```

Or use `npx` directly—no global install needed.

---

## Supported AI Clients

- **Cursor / Claude Desktop**
- **VS Code with MCP extension**
- **Windsurf**
- **Docker (air-gapped CI)**

---

## Available Tools

The MCP server provides tools to interact with your CybeDefend projects:

- **Scan**: `get_scan` - Current state, progress, counts
- **Overview**: `get_project_overview` - Critical/high/… per scanner
- **SAST**: `list_vulnerabilities_sast`, `get_vulnerability_sast`
- **IaC**: `list_vulnerabilities_iac`, `get_vulnerability_iac`
- **SCA**: `list_vulnerabilities_sca`, `get_vulnerability_sca`, `list_sca_packages`

---

## Example Chat Prompts

With your project configured, you can ask your AI assistant:

- "Show critical SAST bugs in Java"
- "How far along is scan abcd-efgh?"
- "Details of vulnerability c0ffee"

Your AI assistant will automatically call the appropriate tools and return formatted results.
