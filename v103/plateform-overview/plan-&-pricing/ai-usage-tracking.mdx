## How Credits Work

### Organization-Level Pooling

Credits are shared across your entire organization:

- **No per-user limits** — credits pool at organization level
- **Flexible distribution** — one developer can use more than another
- **Total matters** — only total organization consumption counts

**Example** — 2 seats × 60 credits = 120 total credits:
- Developer A: 80 credits used
- Developer B: 20 credits used
- **Total**: 100/120 credits (20 remaining)

---

## Reset & Expiration

- **Quotas reset** on your billing cycle date
- **Unused credits expire** at each reset
- **Add-ons expire** at the end of monthly billing periods
