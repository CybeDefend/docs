**GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** is GitHub's container registry for Docker images. CybeDefend integrates with GHCR to scan both public and private container images.

## CybeDefend Configuration

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **GitHub Username** | Your GitHub username or organization | `myorg` |
| **Personal Access Token** | GitHub PAT with `read:packages` scope | `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| **Description** | Optional description for the registry | `Production GitHub Registry` |

## How to Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) in GitHub

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access GitHub Settings">
    Go to GitHub → **Settings** → **Developer settings** → **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate New Token">
    Click **Generate new token** and select **Generate new token (classic)**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Scopes">
    Select the required scopes:
    - `read:packages` (read access)
    - or `write:packages` (read/write access)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy Token">
    Copy the generated token and paste it in CybeDefend
  </Step>
</Steps>

  <Card title="Use Fine-Grained Tokens" icon="fingerprint">
    Prefer fine-grained PATs over classic tokens when possible for better security.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Minimal Scopes" icon="shield-halved">
    Only grant `read:packages` scope for scanning operations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Set Expiration" icon="calendar-xmark">
    Always set an expiration date for your tokens to limit exposure.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rotate Tokens Regularly" icon="rotate">
    Change your access tokens periodically to minimize security risks.

## Troubleshooting

  <Accordion title="Authentication Failed" icon="circle-exclamation">
    - Verify the PAT has `read:packages` scope
    - Check if the token has expired
    - Ensure the username matches the token owner
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Permission Denied" icon="ban">
    - Verify you have access to the repository
    - Check package visibility settings
    - Ensure organization membership for private packages
