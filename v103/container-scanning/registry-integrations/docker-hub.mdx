description: "Connect and scan container images from Docker Hub, the world's largest public container registry."
---

**Docker Hub** is the default registry for Docker containers and hosts millions of public images. CybeDefend's Docker Hub integration allows you to scan both public and private images using Personal Access Token authentication.

## Features

- **Public & Private Images**: Scan both public and private Docker Hub repositories
- **Personal Access Token**: Secure authentication with Docker Hub PAT
- **Official Images**: Access to Docker's official maintained images
- **Community Images**: Scan community-contributed containers
- **Tag Support**: Scan specific versions or latest tags

## CybeDefend Configuration

When connecting your Docker Hub registry in CybeDefend, you'll need to provide:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Nom d'utilisateur DockerHub** | Your Docker Hub username | `username` |
| **Personal Access Token** | Docker Hub Personal Access Token | `dckr_pat_xxxxxxxxxxxx` |

## How to Create a Personal Access Token

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Docker Hub Settings">
    Go to Docker Hub → **Account Settings** → **Security** → **Access Tokens**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create New Token">
    Create a new Access Token with a description (e.g., `cybedefend-scanner`)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Permissions">
    Select **Read-only** permission (recommended for scanning)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy Token">
    Copy the token immediately and paste it in CybeDefend (you won't see it again!)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
The Personal Access Token is only displayed once when created. Make sure to copy it immediately before closing the dialog.
</Warning>

## Image Naming Convention

When scanning Docker Hub images, use the standard naming format:

- **Official Images**: `image:tag` (e.g., `nginx:latest`)
- **User Images**: `username/image:tag` (e.g., `library/hello-world`)
- **Organization Images**: `organization/image:tag`

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Scanning**: Scan base images regularly as new vulnerabilities are discovered
2. **Tag Specificity**: Use specific version tags instead of `latest` for reproducible builds
3. **Layer Analysis**: Review which layers introduce vulnerabilities
4. **Alternative Images**: Consider using Alpine-based images for smaller attack surfaces

<Warning>
Docker Hub has rate limits for anonymous pulls. For high-volume scanning, consider using authenticated access or Docker Hub Pro accounts.
</Warning>
