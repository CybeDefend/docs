CybeDefend's **Dockerfile Security Scanning** analyzes your Dockerfile configurations for security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and best practice violations. This scanning is automatically integrated into your regular code scanning process, ensuring container security is part of your development workflow.

## How It Works

When CybeDefend scans your codebase, it automatically detects Dockerfile files and performs comprehensive security analysis alongside your source code scanning. This integrated approach ensures both your application code and container configurations are secure.

### Automatic Detection

CybeDefend automatically identifies and scans:
- `Dockerfile` files in your repository
- Multi-stage build configurations
- Docker Compose files with build contexts
- Custom Dockerfile variants (e.g., `Dockerfile.prod`, `Dockerfile.dev`)

### Security Analysis

The scanner examines multiple aspects of your Dockerfile:

1. **Base Image Security**
   - Identifies vulnerable base images
   - Recommends secure alternatives
   - Checks for outdated image versions

2. **Configuration Issues**
   - Detects insecure configurations
   - Identifies privilege escalation risks
   - Finds exposed sensitive data

3. **Best Practice Violations**
   - Running containers as root user
   - Missing health checks
   - Inefficient layer management

## Integration with Code Scanning

Dockerfile scanning is seamlessly integrated into your regular code scanning workflow:

### Automatic Inclusion
- No additional configuration required
- Scans run alongside SAST, SCA, and IaC analysis
- Results appear in the same vulnerability dashboard

### Scan Triggers
- **Repository Scans**: Includes all Dockerfiles in the repository
- **CI/CD Integration**: Scans Dockerfiles in pull requests and commits
- **Manual Scans**: On-demand analysis of container configurations

### Results Integration
- Dockerfile issues appear with other security findings
- Severity levels aligned with overall vulnerability scoring
- Remediation guidance provided for each issue

<Note>
Dockerfile security scanning is automatically enabled when you scan repositories containing Docker configurations. No additional setup is required beyond your regular code scanning configuration.
