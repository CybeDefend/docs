description: "Customize your scan configurations—frequency, severity levels, scanning types, and more—to optimize vulnerability detection."

In CybeDefend, you can **tailor** your scans by adjusting several key parameters in the **Project Settings** → **Scanning** section. Below, we outline the five main controls and how they influence your scanning process. Remember that **Fast Scan** and **Dataflow AI** options apply **only** to **SAST** scanning.

## 1. Scanning Frequency

Define **how often** you want CybeDefend to run scans on your repositories or projects. This can be set to **daily**, **weekly**, **monthly**, or **manual** to meet your workflow requirements.

<Tip>
Frequent scans ensure **earlier detection** of new vulnerabilities, minimizing the risk of security issues going undetected.
</Tip>

## 2. Vulnerability Severity Choice

Choose which **severity levels** (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical) are **included** in your scan results. Unchecked severities are **not recorded**, which helps you **focus** on higher-priority vulnerabilities without affecting scan duration.

<Note>
This setting only **filters scan results**; it does **not** impact the actual scanning time or depth.
</Note>

## 3. Type of Scanning

CybeDefend supports multiple scanning methods. You can **enable** any or all methods based on your project needs:

- **SAST** (Static Application Security Testing):  
  Analyzes source code for security flaws before runtime.
- **IAC** (Infrastructure as Code):  
  Detects misconfigurations in your infrastructure (e.g., Terraform, Kubernetes).
- **SCA** (Software Composition Analysis):  
  Inspects open-source dependencies and libraries for known vulnerabilities.

</Frame>

<Tip>
We recommend **activating all** scans for a thorough security posture—unless you have a specific reason to skip one.
</Tip>

## 4. SAST Fast Scanning (SAST Only)

Enable a **fast** version of SAST if you need **quick feedback**:

- Uses fewer scanners, reducing scan time.  
- Potentially yields **fewer** reported vulnerabilities (some deeper checks are disabled).  
- Applicable **only** if **SAST** is enabled.

<Warning>
Fast scanning is best for **early-stage development** or **quick checks**. For production releases, we strongly suggest the **full** SAST scan.
</Warning>

## 5. Dataflow Option (SAST Only, Powered by CybeDefend AI)

When **SAST** is enabled, you can activate CybeDefend AI’s **dataflow analysis** to trace how a variable-based vulnerability travels throughout your codebase. This helps you understand **where** the vulnerability starts and how it propagates.

<Tip>
Visit our [Dataflow Analysis](/get-started/general-information/dataflow-analysis) page to learn more about how variables are traced, from **source** to **sink**.

## Next Steps

1. **Save Your Changes**: After adjusting these parameters, remember to **save** your project settings.  
2. **Trigger a Scan**: Run a new scan or wait until the **next scheduled** frequency to see updated results.  
3. **Review Reports**: Check the scan report to ensure everything is configured as expected.

<Note>
Balancing **scan speed** and **thoroughness** is key. Experiment with different settings to find the right configuration for your team’s workflow.
