CybeDefend’s **Dataflow Analysis** gives you deeper insights into how a vulnerability travels through your code. We focus on whether a **vulnerable line** references a **static value** or a **variable**:

## How It Works

CybeDefend AI identifies a vulnerable line post-scan. It checks if the flag relates to:
  - A **static** element (e.g., password, string literal).  
  - A **variable** (e.g., userInput, configParam).

If static, AI marks it for immediate review (e.g., “Hardcoded Credential”).
If a **variable** is involved, our [Variable Dataflow Tracer](https://github.com/CybeDefend/variable-dataflow-tracer) inspects the codebase to see how the variable flows—tracing it **back to its origin** and following **every use** along the path.

This combined process enables you to quickly pinpoint the critical steps in your code that truly matter, reducing noise and improving fix times.

<Tip>
This feature is in early **alpha** and will continue to evolve. If you have feedback, please share it with us so we can refine multi-file capabilities and expand language coverage.

## About the Variable Dataflow Tracer

The **Variable Dataflow Tracer** is an [open-source tool](https://github.com/CybeDefend/variable-dataflow-tracer) developed by CybeDefend to perform **variable-specific dataflow analysis** across multiple languages (e.g., Go, Python, Java, JavaScript, C/C++, C#, PHP, Ruby, Rust). It can be run standalone as a CLI or integrated as a library, and it:

- **Locates a variable** at a given line in code.
- **Builds a graph** of where that variable originates and how it’s used.
- **Highlights** potential vulnerabilities or logic flaws along the path.

Here’s a quick overview of its key features:

- **Multilingual Support**: Traces variables in several languages and frameworks.  
- **Recursive Data Flow**: Tracks a variable from **source** to **sink**, mapping function calls along the way.  
- **Open Source**: Licensed under Apache 2, contributions are welcome.
