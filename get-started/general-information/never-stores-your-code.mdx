# CybeDefend Never Stores Your Code

CybeDefend is committed to ensuring your code remains private. Our process scanner works as follows:

1. **Select Your Repository**  
   Choose the repository you wish to scan.

2. **Temporary Code Copy**  
   Your code is copied temporarily into a secure container.

3. **Scanner Execution**  
   The scanner runs inside the container, analyzing the code for vulnerabilities.

4. **Extract Vulnerabilities**  
   Detected vulnerabilities are extracted and compiled into a report.

5. **Data Destruction**  
   Once scanning is complete, both the temporary container and code copy are destroyed immediately.
