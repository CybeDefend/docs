# Free Plan & Demonstration Planning

Test CybeDefend risk-free with our Free Plan, designed to let you evaluate our platform on your project. Our structured onboarding process ensures you gain full insights into our capabilities.

## Onboarding Process

- **Kick-Off Presentation & Demonstration:**  
  Start with a live presentation and demo. If you require a signed NDA, we can provide one or review your document.

- **Comprehensive Support:**  
  Enjoy in-app support, dedicated Slack/Teams channels, and detailed developer documentation.

- **Evaluation Form:**  
  Help us improve by providing feedback on:
  - **Ease of Use & Setup:** How intuitive is the platform?
  - **Capabilities:** Do our features and integrations meet your needs? Does our AI integration enhance your focus and prioritization?
  - **Comparisons:** How does our pricing and feature set compare with other providers? Does the AI component make a difference?
  - **Support Quality:** Assess our responsiveness and the quality of our support.
  - **Costs & ROI:** Evaluate whether our pricing is justified by reduced development time on security issues and enhanced overall ROI.
