description: "Learn how CybeDefend leverages Role-Based and Relationship-Based Access Control to provide granular security within your organization."

CybeDefend uses a **dual approach** to access control:
1. **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control) assigns predefined roles, such as Admin or Viewer, to users within specific teams or projects.
2. **ReBAC** (Relationship-Based Access Control) extends this model by considering relationships—like membership in multiple organizations or teams, each with unique roles.

<Note>
ReBAC goes beyond basic role checks by examining the user’s relationship with an entity, allowing more <strong>flexible</strong> and <strong>fine-grained</strong> access rules.

## What is ReBAC?

**Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC)** defines permissions based on the **relationship** between a user and an entity (e.g., “Alice is an Admin in Team1,” or “Bob is a Viewer in OrgA”). This approach is ideal for complex organizations that require nuanced distinctions between user roles and multiple groups or teams.

### Key Advantages of ReBAC

- **Granular Permissions**: Distinguish between different teams, projects, or business units with dynamic relationships.  
- **Scalable Model**: As new users, teams, or roles are added, ReBAC easily adapts without significant refactoring.  
- **Flexible Hierarchies**: Handle nested relationships (e.g., sub-teams) without needing to define every possible role combination in advance.

## Open-Source ReBAC: react-rebac

CybeDefend has also developed an **open-source** library called [**react-rebac**](https://github.com/CybeDefend/react-rebac) to simplify **relationship-based access control** in **React** applications. This library:

- **Manages** user relationships with multiple entities (e.g., organizations, teams).  
- **Conditionally Renders** content based on user roles or relationships.  
- **Supports** single-entity mode and multi-entity mode (checking if the user has access to *any* of several entities).
