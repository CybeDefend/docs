title: "AI-Driven False Positive Reduction"
description: "Leverage dataflow analysis and AI agents to validate complex vulnerabilities and minimize false positives."

CybeDefend is actively building an **AI-based solution** that uses vulnerability’s **dataflow** to **confirm** or **refute** difficult-to-diagnose vulnerabilities—like **path traversal**—by analyzing whether the detected vulnerability truly travels from a **source** to a **sink**.

## How It Works

1. **Dataflow Analysis**  
   During scanning, CybeDefend identifies the path a potentially vulnerable variable takes from its **source** to any **sink** (e.g., file operations, I/O calls).
   To see the tool we use for this, check out our [Variable Dataflow Tracer](/get-started/general-information/dataflow-analysis).

2. **AI Validation**  
   If AI Mode is enabled, our AI agents inspect that path in detail, determining whether the vulnerability is genuinely exploitable or **just a false positive**.

3. **Complex Cases**  
   This approach is especially valuable for vulnerabilities like **path traversal**, where the code context (e.g., sanitization steps, conditional checks) can make or break exploitability.
