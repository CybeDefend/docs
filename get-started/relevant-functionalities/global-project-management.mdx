**CybeDefend** provides a central dashboard to help you see your organization’s security posture at a glance. This page is your go-to hub for the big-picture stats and aggregated vulnerability data across all projects.

## Key Dashboard Sections

1. **High-Risk Projects Count**  
   Instantly see how many projects have critical or high-severity vulnerabilities. This allows teams to prioritize resources where they’re needed most.

2. **Recent Activity (7-Day Window)**  
   - **New Issues**: The number of vulnerabilities discovered in the past week.  
   - **Resolved Issues**: How many vulnerabilities were fixed over the same period, reflecting your team’s remediation efforts.

3. **Pie Chart: Vulnerabilities by Severity**  
   A visual breakdown (Critical, High, Medium, Low) across your entire organization, offering a quick sense of overall risk distribution.

4. **Project List & Severity Counts**  
   Below the summary stats, you’ll find a detailed table of all projects. Each row shows:  
   - **Project Name**  
   - **Open Vulnerabilities by Severity** (e.g., 2 Critical, 5 High, 8 Medium)  
   - **Scanner Type Counts** (SAST, IAC, SCA) if you need to see which analysis is flagging the most issues.

<Note>
The table supports searching by project name. You can also click a project row to jump into its <strong>detailed vulnerability list</strong>.
(PS: of course our API is not vulnerable, it's just an example :) )

## Recommended Usage

- **Daily Standups**: Quickly identify if any new critical vulnerabilities appeared overnight.
- **Reporting**: Export or screenshot this page for management updates on your organization's security trends.
- **Prioritization**: High-risk projects and spikes in new issues are immediate signals where additional focus may be needed.

<Tip>
Stay proactive by scheduling scans at a higher frequency for your “High-Risk Projects” to detect newly introduced vulnerabilities faster.
