title: "AI-Powered Vulnerability Detection"
description: "Leverage advanced AI to reduce false positives and negatives in code and infrastructure scans."
---

Many scanners rely on signature-based or pattern-matching techniques. **CybeDefend** is evolving that paradigm. Our aim: drastically cut down on **false positives** and **false negatives** in both SAST and IAC scans.

---

## Goals & Roadmap

1. **Precision Upgrades**: High detection rates with minimal false alarms.
2. **Seamless User Experience**: End-users see vulnerability results as usual, but with fewer extraneous items.
3. **Continuous Improvement**: The engine evolves with each new dataset, scanning pattern, and feedback loop.
