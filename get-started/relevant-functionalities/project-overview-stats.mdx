# Project Overview & Stats

While the **Project Vulnerability List** highlights current open issues, the **Project Overview** page offers in-depth analytics and historical context. It answers questions like, “Are we reducing critical vulnerabilities over time?” and “Which scanner finds the most issues?”

## Breakdown Charts

1. **Vulnerabilities by Severity**  
   A bar or donut chart showing the split among Critical, High, Medium, Low issues. Perfect for zeroing in on severity hotspots.
2. **Vulnerabilities by Analysis Type**  
   Compares how many issues come from SAST, IAC, or SCA. This can reveal if your code (SAST) or your infrastructure (IAC) demands more attention.
3. **Vulnerabilities by State**  
   Shows how many are Open, In Progress, or Resolved. Great for agile workflows to see if issues keep piling up or are actively being addressed.
4. **Vulnerabilities Over Time**  
   A timeline chart that records how many vulnerabilities exist at any given time in the project’s history. This helps track improvement trends.

<Accordion icon="chart-bar" title="Why These Insights Matter">
  **Severity Analysis**  
  Tells you immediately if your project is dangerously skewed toward high-risk issues.

  **Scanner Comparison**  
  Identifies if you have a gap in coverage. Maybe IAC is producing more critical findings than you expected.

  **State Monitoring**  
  Helps in sprints and retrospectives: Are we resolving issues faster than they appear?

  **Time Series**  
  Offers a clear measure of progress or regression. A downward slope indicates successful remediation.

## Practical Use Cases

- **Management Reporting**: Show weekly or monthly improvements to stakeholders.  
- **Prioritization**: If SAST counts are skyrocketing, your dev team might need more secure coding guidance.  
- **Team Accountability**: Some organizations tie metrics (like “Resolved vs. New Vulnerabilities”) to sprint goals.

<Tip>
Combine this data with your <strong>weekly triage</strong> approach to confirm that your security posture is actually improving.
