# BLSA: Business Logic Security Analysis

Traditional scanners (SAST, IAC, SCA) excel at finding known patterns or misconfigurations. **Business Logic Security Analysis (BLSA)** goes a step further, using **AI agents** to interpret your application’s overall architecture, highlighting **insecure-by-design** issues that can’t be detected by standard rule-based tools.

## Why BLSA?

1. **Contextual Understanding**  
   AI doesn’t just read lines of code—it <strong>understands</strong> how different parts interact, spotting vulnerabilities when business flows are implemented incorrectly (e.g., logic around payment processing or user account privileges).

2. **Agent-Based Analysis**  
   Each AI “agent” focuses on a segment of your code, forming an overall “mental model.” This is especially valuable for complex monoliths or microservices that standard scanners struggle to piece together.

3. **Split Prompting & Intelligent Correlation**  
   We split large codebases into chunks (split prompting) so our AI system can analyze the entire repository in detail, then reassemble findings into a single, cohesive report.

<Warning>
While BLSA is <strong>in development</strong>, we aim to release early previews to select users. Keep an eye on our [Roadmap](https://progress.cybedefend.com/en/roadmap) for updates!

## Potential Impact

- **Uncover Hidden Flaws**: Identify logic breaks that hackers can exploit, such as bypassing payment checks or manipulating workflow states.
- **Reduce Manual Audits**: BLSA can flag suspicious flows that might otherwise require specialized security consultants.
- **Enhance DevSecOps**: Integrating BLSA results alongside SAST, IAC, and SCA ensures a complete coverage of technical and logical vulnerabilities.

<Tip>
Although we can't share the complete <strong>technical architecture</strong> (to protect our IP), we’re excited to show <strong>practical demos</strong> once BLSA hits beta!
