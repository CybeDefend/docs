## Explore CybeDefend

### What is CybeDefend?

CybeDefend is a revolutionary SaaS cybersecurity platform designed to protect business applications against cyberattacks. By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence, our solution not only detects vulnerabilities but also analyzes them intelligently, eliminates false positives, and prioritizes real threats—ensuring robust security accessible to businesses of every size.

### Motivation

Our journey began with firsthand experiences of cyberattacks and the costly rework that follows when vulnerabilities are detected too late. With CybeDefend, security is embedded at the very beginning of the development cycle—not as an afterthought. This proactive approach prevents the need to reverse entire development loops and fixes vulnerabilities early, saving both time and resources.

### With CybeDefend, You Can

- **Secure Your Digital Assets:** Protect your applications and data from evolving cyber threats from the very first line of code.
- **Automate Vulnerability Management:** Leverage AI to reduce false positives and streamline remediation.
- **Gain a Unified View:** Access a single, integrated dashboard that combines all the standard security tools (SAST, DAST, SCA, etc.) with our innovative new features.
- **Innovate Beyond the Norm:** Not only do we provide all the tools that our competitors offer, but we also push the envelope by introducing BLSA—a revolutionary new scanner that sets a new industry standard.

## Security Analysis as a Service

### A Unified Platform with Comprehensive Tools

CybeDefend offers a complete, all-in-one security solution that integrates every essential tool—SAST, DAST, SCA, and more—into a single, cohesive platform. Unlike traditional solutions that address security only after development is complete, our approach embeds security early on, making your development lifecycle smoother and more secure.

### Benefit of AI to Go Faster

At the core of our platform is state-of-the-art AI technology that:
- **Reduces Manual Effort:** Automatically filters out false positives.
- **Speeds Up Remediation:** Quickly identifies and prioritizes threats.
- **Continuously Learns:** Adapts over time, ensuring enhanced security as new threats emerge.

## Evolution and Innovation: Introducing BLSA

### What is BLSA?

BLSA (Business Logic Security Analysis) is our innovative, next-generation scanner that uses AI agents to detect vulnerabilities in business logic—ensuring security by design from the outset. This breakthrough tool:
- **Detects Business Logic Flaws:** Uncovers vulnerabilities in the fundamental design of your applications that traditional scanners often miss.
- **Utilizes AI Agents:** Leverages intelligent agents to continuously monitor and analyze application logic for potential security risks.
- **Ensures Security by Design:** Integrates security measures early in the development process, preventing costly rework later on.
- **Complements Traditional Tools:** Works seamlessly alongside SAST, DAST, and SCA, providing a comprehensive 360° view of your security posture.
