CybeDefend offers flexible structures to keep your organization and teams organized. Each **Organization** can have multiple **Teams**, and each Team can own projects (the codebase). This helps segment permissions and simplify collaboration.

## Inviting Organization Members

2. **Pending Invitations**  
   - Once invited, the user appears in the member list with a **Pending** status.
   - You can cancel the invite at any time if needed.

3. **User Acceptance Flow**  
   - **Receive Email**: The invitee gets an email with a unique link.  
   - **Sign Up or Log In**: If they don’t have a CybeDefend account, they’ll be prompted to create one.  
   - **Accept Invitation**: After confirming, they’re redirected to the main dashboard with new **Organization Access**.
