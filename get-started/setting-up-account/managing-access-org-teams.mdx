CybeDefend offers flexible structures to keep your organization and teams organized. Each **Organization** can have multiple **Teams**, and each Team can own projects (the codebase). This helps segment permissions and simplify collaboration.

<Tip>
Teams are ideal for grouping people working on the same projects or requiring similar levels of access.

## How to Create Projects

Before creating your first project, decide how you want to add your code to CybeDefend:

1. **Recommended: Link a Git Provider**  
   If you haven’t installed the GitHub (or GitLab, Bitbucket) integration yet, go to our [Integration Setup](/get-started/integration-guides) page for instructions.
2. **Alternatively: Upload a ZIP**  
   You can upload your code in a zip file, but this is primarily for quick or offline testing. We strongly recommend connecting a Git repository for the best DevSecOps experience.

### Steps to Create a Project

1. **Home → Create Project**  
   In your organization’s home page, click **Create Project**.

2. **Select Your Method**  
   - **Continue with GitHub (or another Git provider)**: Pick your repository, then assign it to a specific team.

   - **Upload ZIP**: Provide your archive if you haven’t integrated a Git provider or need a short-term solution.

3. **Set Scan Parameters**  
   Adjust scanning frequency, severity levels, and advanced options like **SAST Fast Scan** or **Dataflow AI**. You can see more details in our [Scan Project Parameters](/get-started/general-information/scan-parameters) guide.



<Note>
While ZIP uploads can help in unique scenarios or offline testing, connecting a Git repository is the recommended approach for continuous, automated scans.

## Inviting Organization Members

2. **Pending Invitations**  
   - Once invited, the user appears in the member list with a **Pending** status.
   - You can cancel the invite at any time if needed.

3. **User Acceptance Flow**  
   - **Receive Email**: The invitee gets an email with a unique link.  
   - **Sign Up or Log In**: If they don’t have a CybeDefend account, they’ll be prompted to create one.  
   - **Accept Invitation**: After confirming, they’re redirected to the main dashboard with new **Organization Access**.

<Note>
Admins can revoke an invitation before it’s accepted, ensuring you maintain full control over who joins your organization.
