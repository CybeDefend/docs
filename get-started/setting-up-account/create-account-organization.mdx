CybeDefend simplifies onboarding by allowing you to create an account through **OAuth2** (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, or GitLab). After signing in, you can form an **Organization** to group your projects and manage access. Once your repositories are connected, CybeDefend automatically starts scanning them.

---

## 1. Create an Account via OAuth2

1. **Go to the CybeDefend Registration Page**  
   Choose the sign-up option of your choice (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, GitLab).
2. **Authorize Your Credentials**  
   OAuth2 ensures a secure handshake without requiring you to store new passwords.
3. **Complete Your Profile**  
   Provide your name and agree to our Terms of Service to finalize your account creation.

## 2. Create Your Organization

1. **Access the Form**  
   After your first login, you’ll be prompted to create an **Organization**. Alternatively, visit **Organization Settings** → **New Organization**.
2. **Fill in Details**  
   Provide an organization name, an optional description, and (if needed) a logo.
3. **Save & Continue**  
   This sets up your top-level group where teams and projects will live.

## 3. Connect Your Repositories

1. **Select Your Version Control Platform**  
   CybeDefend supports GitHub. Check out our [Detailed Integration Guides](/get-started/integration-guides) for each platform.
2. **Authorize Access**  
   Approve read (and optionally write) permissions so we can scan your code.
3. **Pick Your Repositories**  
   Choose which repos to include in your **Organization**. You can assign them to specific teams or projects later.
4. **Instant Scanning**  
   As soon as you connect a repository, CybeDefend triggers an initial scan, identifying potential vulnerabilities.

<Tip>
Once your repositories are connected, scans start automatically—no extra steps required.
