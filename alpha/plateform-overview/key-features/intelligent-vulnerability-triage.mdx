title: "Intelligent Vulnerability Triage"
description: "Rank and focus on your most critical issues using AI-driven exploitability and relevance scoring."

CybeDefend’s **Intelligent Vulnerability Triage** aims to automate prioritization across all findings. Our AI will consider factors like **exploitability**, **public exploit availability**, and **application-specific relevance**—ensuring teams fix the **most dangerous** items first.

## How Triage Works

1. **Exploitability Assessment**  
   Checks if known exploits exist in the wild or if the issue can be triggered easily, raising its rank.
2. **Application Relevance**  
   A critical bug in a rarely used feature might rank below a moderate bug in a core module. The AI weighs usage frequency or code references.
3. **Scoring & Sorting**  
   Each vulnerability receives a composite score, letting you view a top-down list of what to fix first.

<Accordion icon="tachometer" title="Beyond Severity">
  <strong>Severity</strong> is important, but triage also factors:
  - CVSS base scores
  - Real-world exploit mentions
  - Historical breach data
  - Business impact
</Accordion>

## Potential Benefits

- **Time Savings**  
  Instantly ranks thousands of issues, freeing your security team from manual triage.
- **Continuous Adjustments**  
  As code or infrastructure changes, the triage score updates, keeping prioritization in sync with reality.
- **Risk Reduction**  
  Closing your most easily exploitable paths first drastically mitigates potential breaches.

<Tip>
Combine Intelligent Triage with <strong>Cross-Analysis</strong> to see not only the most critical issues, but also how they might compound with other vulnerabilities.
