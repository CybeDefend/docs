In many organizations, a **Security Champion** is a designated person who advises on secure coding and best practices. **CybeDefend** replaces (or augments) that role with an **integrated chatbot** that automatically understands the context of each vulnerability, offering immediate guidance right in your dashboard.

## What Is a Security Champion?

Traditionally, a Security Champion is a **developer** or **security professional** embedded in a team to ensure that:

- Code reviews catch serious issues.  
- Project decisions factor in security from day one.  
- Team members have a go-to resource for quick answers.

**CybeDefend’s Security Champion** aims to provide these benefits, but **on-demand** and **context-aware**:

1. **Contextual Awareness**  
   When you click on a vulnerability, the chatbot automatically knows the details—no more copy-pasting logs or line references.

2. **Guided Solutions**  
   You can ask, “How do I fix this SQL injection?” and get suggestions tailored to your tech stack.

3. **Proactive Assistance**  
   Enable the chatbot on any page for best practice tips, DevSecOps references, or clarifications about scanning parameters.

## How It Works

1. **Activate Chat**  
   A floating chat icon or side panel appears in the dashboard. Click to open.  
2. **Navigate to Vulnerability**  
   If you’re viewing a specific vulnerability, the chatbot auto-loads that context.  
3. **Ask for Help**  
   The AI references logs, scanner outputs, or known CVE patterns to provide actionable solutions.
4. **General Mode**  
   If the AI is opened on, say, the **Global Project Management** page, it can offer broader DevSecOps advice, explain scanning strategies, or reference official docs.
