If your PHP application uses **Composer**, CybeDefend can detect vulnerabilities in your `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files. However, you'll get the **best** results if you have a lockfile with pinned dependencies.

## Recommended Steps

1. **Install Dependencies with Composer**  
   Run `composer install` to generate a `composer.lock` file if you don't already have one.  
2. **Commit the Lockfile**  
   Always commit `composer.lock` to your repository. This ensures that the entire team, and CybeDefend, see the exact dependency versions.
3. **Keep Your Lockfile Updated**  
   When you want to update dependencies, use `composer update` or `composer require` and commit the updated lockfile.

<Note>
While CybeDefend can scan projects with only a <code>composer.json</code> file, we strongly recommend generating and committing the <code>composer.lock</code> file for more accurate vulnerability detection.

## Supported Files for PHP/Composer

| File Examples      | 
|--------------------|
| `composer.json`, `composer.lock` |

<Warning>
Never edit your <strong>composer.lock</strong> file manually. Always let Composer handle this file to ensure proper dependency resolution.
</Warning>

<Tip>
If you're using development dependencies, be aware that these are also included in the security scanning. Consider carefully which packages you include, even as development dependencies.
