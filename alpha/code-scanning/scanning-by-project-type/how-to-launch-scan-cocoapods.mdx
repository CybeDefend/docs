**iOS** and **macOS** projects managed with CocoaPods use a `Podfile.lock` file to pin exact dependency versions. CybeDefend leverages this file to accurately detect vulnerabilities in your CocoaPods dependencies.

## Recommended Steps

1. **Generate Podfile.lock**  
   Run the following command in your project directory (where your Podfile is located):
   ```bash
   pod install
   ```
   
   This will download your dependencies and generate a `Podfile.lock` file.

2. **Commit Podfile.lock to Your Repository**  
   Always commit the `Podfile.lock` file to ensure all developers and CI systems use identical dependencies.

3. **Keep Podfile.lock Updated**  
   When you update dependencies in your `Podfile`, regenerate the lockfile with:
   ```bash
   # Update all dependencies
   pod update
   
   # Update a specific dependency
   pod update PODNAME
   ```

## Understanding Podfile.lock

The `Podfile.lock` file contains a snapshot of all your project's dependencies with their exact versions. This ensures:

- Reproducible builds across your team's environments
- Protection against unexpected dependency changes
- More accurate security scanning by CybeDefend

## Supported Files for CocoaPods

| File Examples      |
|-------------------|
| `Podfile`, `Podfile.lock` |

<Note>
Without a <code>Podfile.lock</code> file, CybeDefend's SCA scanner can only use version constraints from <code>Podfile</code>, which may not accurately represent the actual dependencies used in your build.
</Note>

<Warning>
Never edit <code>Podfile.lock</code> manually. Always use CocoaPods commands to manage it.
</Warning>

<Tip>
For better dependency management, consider using the <code>pod outdated</code> command to check for available updates to your dependencies before updating the lockfile.
