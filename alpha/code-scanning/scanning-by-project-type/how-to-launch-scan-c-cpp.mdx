import UseLockfiles from '/snippets/lockfiles.mdx';

CybeDefend supports scanning C/C++ code for vulnerabilities in your source files and **conan.lock** for dependency management. By committing this lockfile to your repository, you enhance security scanning and ensure consistent builds.

## Recommended Steps

1. **Adopt Conan (or Another Manager)**  
   If you rely on external libraries, use a package manager like **Conan** that can produce `conan.lock`.
2. **Generate & Commit conan.lock**  
   - Run `conan install` (or equivalent) to produce the lockfile.  
   - Commit `conan.lock` so everyone uses the exact same library versions.
3. **Keep a Clean Codebase**  
   Add any `.deps/` or build artifacts to `.gitignore` so that only the lockfile and source are tracked.

## Supported Files for C/C++

| File Examples |
|--------------|
| `conan.lock`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `.cpp`, `.h` |

<Note>
CybeDefend can detect vulnerabilities in known C/C++ libraries if your lockfile references them. Without a lockfile, your scanning might be incomplete or prone to version ambiguity.
</Note>

<Warning>
Always re-run <strong>conan install</strong> or <strong>conan lock create</strong> after updating library versions, and commit the new lockfile to keep CybeDefend scanning accurate.
</Warning>
