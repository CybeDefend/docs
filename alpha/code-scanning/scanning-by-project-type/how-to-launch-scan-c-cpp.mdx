CybeDefend supports scanning C/C++ code for vulnerabilities in your source files and **conan.lock** for dependency management. By committing this lockfile to your repository, you enhance security scanning and ensure consistent builds.

## Recommended Steps

1. **Adopt Conan (or Another Manager)**  
   If you rely on external libraries, use a package manager like **Conan** that can produce `conan.lock`.
2. **Generate & Commit conan.lock**  
   - Ensure you have a Conan profile set up: `conan profile detect` (if needed)
   - Run `conan lock create . --lockfile-out=conan.lock` to produce the lockfile.  
   - Run `conan install` to install dependencies using your lockfile.
   - Commit `conan.lock` so everyone uses the exact same library versions.
3. **Keep a Clean Codebase**  
   Add any `.deps/` or build artifacts to `.gitignore` so that only the lockfile and source are tracked.

## Generating a Conan Lockfile

For Conan 2.x projects, use the following command in your project directory:

```bash
conan lock create . --lockfile-out=conan.lock
```

For older Conan 1.x projects, use:

```bash
conan lock create conanfile.py --lockfile=conan.lock
```

## Supported Files for C/C++

| File Examples |
|--------------|
| `conan.lock`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `conanfile.py`, `conanfile.txt` |

<Note>
CybeDefend can detect vulnerabilities in known C/C++ libraries if your lockfile references them. Without a lockfile, your scanning might be incomplete or prone to version ambiguity.
</Note>

<Warning>
Always re-run <strong>conan lock create</strong> after updating library versions, and commit the new lockfile to keep CybeDefend scanning accurate.
</Warning>
