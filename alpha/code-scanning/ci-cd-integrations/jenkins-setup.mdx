**Jenkins** is a widely used CI/CD tool that you can host on-prem or in the cloud. By installing the **CybeDefend CLI** on your Jenkins agent, you can securely run scans locally and upload the results to CybeDefend.

## Requirements

1. **API Key**  
   Follow [Introduction & API Key Creation](/alpha/code-scanning/local-code-scanning/introduction-api-key) to generate and store a key in Jenkins credentials.
2. **Operating System**  
   Jenkins agent must be on a supported OS (Linux x86_64, Windows, macOS). For Linux, ensure `glibc >= 2.27`.
3. **Sufficient Resources**  
   At least 2–4 GB RAM, plus the recommended disk space for your repo.

<Note>
By default, we recommend scanning the <strong>main</strong> (or <strong>master</strong>) branch to avoid mixing partial results across multiple branches.
</Note>

## Option 1: Docker-Based Scanning

If your Jenkins agent supports Docker, run the **CybeDefend** scanner image:

1. **Create a New Jenkins Project**  
   - Choose **Pipeline** or **Freestyle** with a Docker step.
2. **Configure Docker**  
   Make sure your agent can run containers.
3. **Build Step**:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v $WORKSPACE:/app \
  -w /app \
  cybedefend/local-scanner:latest \
  cybedefend scan . --api-key $CYBEDEFEND_API_KEY --project-id $CYBEDEFEND_PROJECT_ID --ci
```

### Explanation
- **-v $WORKSPACE:/app**: Mount your code from Jenkins into `/app`.
- **cybedefend/local-scanner:latest**: Our Docker image containing the CLI.
- **--ci**: Outputs minimal logs for a clean pipeline.

  <p>We suggest setting <strong>Branch Specifier</strong> to main or master in your Jenkins job, so scans remain consistent.</p>

## Option 2: Installing the Binary Directly

1. **Download the Binary**  
   In a shell build step:
   ```bash
   curl -L https://github.com/CybeDefend/cybedefend-cli/releases/download/v1.0.0/cybedefend-linux-amd64 -o cybedefend
   chmod +x cybedefend
   sudo mv cybedefend /usr/local/bin/
   ```
2. **Run the Scan**  
   ```bash
   cybedefend scan . \
     --api-key $CYBEDEFEND_API_KEY \
     --project-id $CYBEDEFEND_PROJECT_ID \
     --ci
   ```

<Note>
If this is your first time scanning the repo, a new project is created in CybeDefend. On subsequent scans, results are appended under the same <strong>Project ID</strong>.
</Note>

## Checking Results

- **Jenkins Console Output**: Quick summary of discovered vulnerabilities.  
- **CybeDefend “results” command**: Add a new step to fetch more detailed results in JSON, HTML, or SARIF.  
- **CybeDefend Dashboard**: Provides an in-depth view, charts, and historical vulnerability data.

<Warning>
For large repos, scanning may take a few minutes. Adjust <strong>Timeout</strong> settings accordingly.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Consider gating a release by parsing CLI output or exit codes, failing the build if high-severity issues remain.
