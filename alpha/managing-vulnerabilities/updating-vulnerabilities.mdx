CybeDefend streamlines remediation by letting you **update each vulnerability** (found by SAST, IAC, or SCA) directly from the dashboard. Whether you’re marking it as “In Progress” or adding a priority label, you can keep the entire team aligned.

## Steps to Update

1. **Open the Vulnerability**  
   In the project’s vulnerability list, click a specific item to reveal the **Update Popup**.
2. **Edit Fields**  
   - **Status**: Switch from To Verify → Confirmed.  
   - **Priority**: Assign internal priority tags (e.g., critical, low). 
   - **Comment**: Record progress, decisions made, or references to external tickets.
3. **Confirm & Save**  
   Changes are immediately visible to all team members, helping them see updated statuses without additional overhead.

<Note>
Use the comment field for quick, contextual notes. This eliminates the need for separate emails or Slack threads where details can get lost.

## Consistent Management Across Scanners

A critical SAST finding about SQL injection can be handled the same way as a high-severity IAC misconfiguration in Terraform. This uniform approach:

- **Reduces Confusion**: No separate tools or flows for each scanner.  
- **Speeds Remediation**: Everyone uses the same interface, no matter the vulnerability source.

<Tip>
Consider adopting <strong>weekly triage sessions</strong> where you review newly detected vulnerabilities and update them as a team.
