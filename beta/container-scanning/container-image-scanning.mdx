CybeDefend's **Container Image Scanning** provides comprehensive security analysis for your Docker containers and images. Whether you're using public images from Docker Hub or private images from your organization's registry, our scanning engine identifies vulnerabilities in your container layers and dependencies.

## Scanning Options

### Public Container Images

Scan any publicly available container image from popular registries:

- **Docker Hub**: Pull and scan any public image directly by name
- **Public Registries**: Access images from GCR, ECR, and other public repositories
- **Official Images**: Scan official language runtime images, database images, and more
- **Community Images**: Analyze community-maintained containers for security issues

### Private Container Images

Securely scan your organization's private container images:

- **Private Registries**: Connect to your private Docker registries with authentication
- **Secure Access**: Use API keys, tokens, or service accounts for secure access
- **Organization Images**: Scan custom-built images from your CI/CD pipelines
- **Multi-Registry Support**: Connect multiple private registries simultaneously

## How Container Scanning Works

1. **Image Selection**  
   Choose to scan either a public image by name or connect to your private registry to select specific images.

2. **Layer Analysis**  
   Our scanner analyzes each layer of your container image, examining:
   - Base operating system vulnerabilities
   - Installed packages and libraries
   - Application dependencies
   - Configuration files

3. **Vulnerability Detection**  
   Identify security issues across multiple categories:
   - **CVE Vulnerabilities**: Known security vulnerabilities in packages
   - **Malware Detection**: Scan for malicious code or suspicious files
   - **Secrets Scanning**: Detect exposed API keys, passwords, or tokens
   - **Configuration Issues**: Identify misconfigurations and security weaknesses

4. **Results & Reporting**  
   Get detailed reports with:
   - Vulnerability severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Affected packages and versions
   - Remediation recommendations
   - Layer-by-layer breakdown
