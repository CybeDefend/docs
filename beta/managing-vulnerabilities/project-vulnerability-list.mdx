description: "Dive into a specific project's vulnerabilities, with filters and sorting for clear organization."

Once you select a project from the **Global Dashboard**, you’ll land on the **Project Vulnerability List**. This section consolidates **all vulnerabilities** for a single project—whether discovered by SAST, IAC, or SCA scanning.

## Scanner Tabs & Filters

1. **Scanner Tabs**  
   Switch between **SAST**, **IAC**, or **SCA** tabs to isolate vulnerabilities discovered by each scanner type. This helps you focus on code issues, infrastructure misconfigurations, or library dependencies, respectively.
2. **Severity Filter**  
   Show or hide vulnerabilities at different severity levels (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).
3. **Status Filter**  
   Limit results to vulnerabilities marked **To Verify**, **In Progress** or **Resolved** etc.
4. **Priority Filter**  
   If you’ve tagged vulnerabilities with internal priorities (Critical Urgent, Urgent, Normal, High, Low), you can quickly narrow down the list to see which require immediate attention.
5. **Sort Options**  
   - **Severity**: Sort by ascending or descending severity.  
   - **CVSS Score** (SCA-only): Sort libraries by their numeric score to find the most dangerous dependencies first.

  **1. Break it down by Scanner**  
  If your codebase is quite large, start with SAST to address code-based vulnerabilities, then move on to IAC for cloud misconfigurations.

  **2. Sort by Priority**  
  Combining severity + priority helps you quickly form a top-10 list to tackle.

  **3. Batch Update**  
  Some teams use a weekly bug triage meeting to set statuses or priorities for multiple vulnerabilities at once.

<Tip>
Always re-run or schedule scans after significant code or infrastructure changes to keep this list accurate.
