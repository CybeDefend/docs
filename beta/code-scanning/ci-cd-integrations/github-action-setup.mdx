title: "GitHub Action Setup for Local Code Scanning"

By default, CybeDefend can scan GitHub repos in the cloud. If you prefer **not** to grant direct GitHub access, you can run local scans in your **GitHub Actions** pipeline, uploading code to CybeDefend yourself.

The easiest way to achieve this is by using the official **CybeDefend GitHub Action**.

## Prerequisites

  - **API Key**: [Create and store](/alpha/code-scanning/local-code-scanning/introduction-api-key) it in your repository's **Settings → Secrets** → **Actions** (e.g., `CYBEDEFEND_API_KEY`).
  - **Project ID**: You should also store your CybeDefend Project ID as a secret (e.g., `CYBEDEFEND_PROJECT_ID`).

## Using the CybeDefend Action

The [CybeDefend Action](https://github.com/CybeDefend/cybedefend-action) runs security scans easily in your CI/CD pipelines using the official CybeDefend CLI, powered by Docker (`ghcr.io/cybedefend/cybedefend-cli:latest`).

### Inputs

| Name        | Description                | Required | Default |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| `api_key`   | API Key for authentication | ✅        |         |
| `project_id`| Project ID for the scan    | ✅        |         |

### Example Workflow: `.github/workflows/cybedefend-scan.yml`

Add the following steps to your workflow file:

```yaml
name: CybeDefend Security Scan

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Or your desired branch

jobs:
  cybedefend_scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Or a later version

      - name: Run CybeDefend Security Scan
        uses: CybeDefend/cybedefend-action@v1
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.CYBEDEFEND_API_KEY }}
          project_id: ${{ secrets.CYBEDEFEND_PROJECT_ID }}

```

This workflow checks out your code and then runs the CybeDefend action, which handles the scanning process using the provided API key and project ID.

## Checking Your Results

- **Action Logs**: The job logs in GitHub Actions show a brief summary of vulnerabilities discovered during the scan.
- **CybeDefend Dashboard**: Log in to your CybeDefend account to view full vulnerability details, manage issues, and track historical scan data for your project.

<Tip>
Consider restricting scanning to your main development branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`). Use scans on feature branches if you want to catch new issues before they are merged.
