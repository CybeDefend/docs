**Python** projects managed with Poetry use a `poetry.lock` file to pin exact dependency versions. CybeDefend leverages this file to accurately detect vulnerabilities in your Python dependencies.

## Recommended Steps

1. **Generate poetry.lock**  
   Run one of these commands in your project directory:
   ```bash
   # If you already have a pyproject.toml file
   poetry lock
   
   # If starting a new project
   poetry init  # Follow the prompts
   poetry add package_name  # Add dependencies
   ```

2. **Commit poetry.lock to Your Repository**  
   Always commit the `poetry.lock` file to ensure all developers and CI systems use identical dependencies.

3. **Keep poetry.lock Updated**  
   When you update dependencies, regenerate the lockfile with:
   ```bash
   # Update all dependencies
   poetry update
   
   # Update a specific dependency
   poetry update package_name
   ```

## Troubleshooting Lockfile Generation

If you encounter Python version compatibility issues when generating a lockfile, try:

```bash
# Specify a Python version that works with your dependencies
poetry env use python3.x
poetry lock

# If you need to ignore certain dependency conflict issues
poetry lock --no-update
```

## Supported Files for Python Poetry

| File Examples       |
|--------------------|
| `pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock` |

<Note>
Without a <code>poetry.lock</code> file, CybeDefend's SCA scanner can only use version constraints from <code>pyproject.toml</code>, which may not accurately represent the actual dependencies used in your application.
</Note>

<Warning>
Never edit <code>poetry.lock</code> manually. Always use Poetry commands to manage it.
</Warning>

<Tip>
If your project has complex Python version requirements, consider using <code>poetry.lock</code> alongside a <code>.python-version</code> or <code>.tool-versions</code> file to ensure consistent Python versions across environments.
