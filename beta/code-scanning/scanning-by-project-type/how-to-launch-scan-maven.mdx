If your Java application uses **Maven**, CybeDefend can detect vulnerabilities in your pom.xml, `.jar`, `.war`, or `.ear` files. However, you'll get the **best** results if you explicitly pin or lock dependencies to stable versions.

## Recommended Steps

1. **Pin Versions in pom.xml**  
   Make sure each dependency in `<dependencies>` includes a specific version number:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
     <groupId>org.example</groupId>
     <artifactId>example-library</artifactId>
     <version>1.2.3</version> <!-- Use exact version, not ranges -->
   </dependency>
   ```

2. **Use a Lockfile-Like Approach**  
   While Maven doesn't have an official universal lockfile, certain plugins or pinned version strategies replicate the effect.
   - **Dependency Management**: Use `<dependencyManagement>` in your parent pom to centralize version definitions.
   - **Versions Maven Plugin**: Tools like `versions:lock-snapshots` or `versions:use-releases` can help freeze your dependencies.
   - **Maven Enforcer**: Consider using the enforcer plugin to ban dependency version ranges.

3. **Generate Flattened POM**  
   The Maven Flatten Plugin creates a simplified POM with all versions resolved:
   ```xml
   <plugin>
     <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
     <artifactId>flatten-maven-plugin</artifactId>
     <version>1.3.0</version>
     <configuration>
       <flattenMode>resolveCiFriendliesOnly</flattenMode>
     </configuration>
     <executions>
       <execution>
         <goals>
           <goal>flatten</goal>
         </goals>
       </execution>
     </executions>
   </plugin>
   ```

4. **Store pom.xml in Repo**  
   This ensures that the entire team, and CybeDefend, see the exact dependency versions.

<Note>
For advanced usage, some teams generate `.flattened-pom.xml` or use ephemeral lock plugins. The key is to produce a stable, pinned set of dependencies that <strong>CybeDefend</strong> can accurately scan.
</Note>

## Supported Files for Java/Maven

| File Examples      | 
|--------------------|
| `pom.xml`, `.jar`, `.war`, `.ear`, `.flattened-pom.xml` |

<Warning>
Remember to <strong>re-run Maven</strong> and commit any updated metadata or flattened POM files if your plugin of choice modifies them.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Once your Maven project is ready, create a new project in CybeDefend referencing this codebase. SCA scanning will detect vulnerabilities in pinned dependencies more accurately.
