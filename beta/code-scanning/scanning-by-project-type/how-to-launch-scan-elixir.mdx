**Elixir** projects managed with Mix use a `mix.lock` file to pin exact dependency versions. CybeDefend leverages this file to accurately detect vulnerabilities in your Elixir dependencies.

## Recommended Steps

1. **Generate mix.lock**  
   Run the following command in your project directory:
   ```bash
   mix deps.get
   ```
   
   This will download your dependencies and generate a `mix.lock` file.

2. **Commit mix.lock to Your Repository**  
   Always commit the `mix.lock` file to ensure all developers and CI systems use identical dependencies.

3. **Keep mix.lock Updated**  
   When you update dependencies in `mix.exs`, regenerate the lockfile with:
   ```bash
   # Update all dependencies
   mix deps.update --all
   
   # Update a specific dependency
   mix deps.update dependency_name
   ```

## Understanding mix.lock

The `mix.lock` file contains a snapshot of all your project's dependencies with their exact versions and checksums. This ensures:

- Reproducible builds across environments
- Protection against unexpected dependency changes
- More accurate security scanning

## Supported Files for Elixir

| File Examples      |
|-------------------|
| `mix.exs`, `mix.lock` |

<Note>
Without a <code>mix.lock</code> file, CybeDefend's SCA scanner can only use version constraints from <code>mix.exs</code>, which may not accurately represent the actual dependencies used in your build.
</Note>

<Warning>
Never edit <code>mix.lock</code> manually. Always use Mix commands to manage it.
</Warning>

<Tip>
For Elixir umbrella applications, ensure each sub-application has its dependencies properly declared and that the root <code>mix.lock</code> file is committed to your repository.
