**Go** projects use the `go.sum` file to validate the checksums and versions of dependencies. CybeDefend leverages this file to accurately detect vulnerabilities in your Go dependencies.

## Recommended Steps

1. **Generate go.sum**  
   Run one of these commands in your project directory:
   ```bash
   # Initialize a new module if you don't have a go.mod file
   go mod init your-module-name
   
   # Download dependencies and generate go.sum
   go mod tidy
   ```

2. **Commit Both go.mod and go.sum**  
   Always commit both files to your repository. This ensures that:
   - Exact versions are used (`go.mod`)
   - Dependency integrity is verified (`go.sum`)

3. **Keep Dependencies Updated**  
   To update dependencies, run:
   ```bash
   # Update all dependencies
   go get -u ./...
   
   # Update a specific dependency
   go get -u github.com/example/dependency
   
   # Regenerate go.sum with updated dependencies
   go mod tidy
   ```

## Understanding go.sum

Unlike other lockfiles, `go.sum` doesn't just record versionsâ€”it stores cryptographic checksums for each dependency version. This ensures:

- Integrity verification of code
- Protection against dependency tampering
- Exact reproducibility of builds

## Supported Files for Go

| File Examples     |
|-------------------|
| `go.mod`, `go.sum` |

<Note>
Without a <code>go.sum</code> file, CybeDefend's SCA scanner can only use version constraints from <code>go.mod</code>, which might not provide enough information for accurate vulnerability matching.
</Note>

<Warning>
Never edit the <code>go.sum</code> file manually. Always use Go commands to manage it.
</Warning>

<Tip>
To ensure your dependencies are secured against supply chain attacks, consider enabling Go's checksum database with <code>GOSUMDB=sum.golang.org</code> and using <code>go mod verify</code> regularly.
