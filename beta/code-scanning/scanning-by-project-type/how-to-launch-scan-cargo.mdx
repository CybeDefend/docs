import UseLockfiles from '/snippets/lockfiles.mdx';

**Rust** projects managed with Cargo generate a `Cargo.lock` file that precisely pins dependency versions. CybeDefend uses this file to accurately detect vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

## Recommended Steps

1. **Generate Cargo.lock**  
   Run one of these commands in your project directory:
   ```bash
   # If you're building an application
   cargo build  # Automatically generates Cargo.lock
   
   # Or if you just want the lockfile without building
   cargo generate-lockfile
   ```

2. **Commit Cargo.lock to Your Repository**  
   For applications, always commit the `Cargo.lock` file to ensure all developers and CI systems use identical dependencies.
   
   For libraries, the Rust community convention is not to commit the lockfile, but for CybeDefend scanning, we recommend generating and committing it anyway.

3. **Keep Cargo.lock Updated**  
   When you update dependencies in `Cargo.toml`, regenerate the lockfile with:
   ```bash
   cargo update  # Updates all dependencies
   # OR
   cargo update -p package-name  # Updates specific package
   ```

## Cargo.lock for Library Crates

While the Rust community convention is not to commit `Cargo.lock` for library crates, for security scanning purposes with CybeDefend we recommend:

1. Generate the lockfile with `cargo generate-lockfile`
2. Commit it to your repository
3. Add a note in your README that the lockfile is committed for security scanning purposes

## Supported Files for Rust

| File Examples       |
|--------------------|
| `Cargo.lock`, `Cargo.toml` |

<Note>
Without a <code>Cargo.lock</code> file, CybeDefend's SCA scanner can only use version constraints from <code>Cargo.toml</code>, which may not accurately represent the actual dependencies used in your build.
</Note>

<Warning>
Never edit <code>Cargo.lock</code> manually. Always use Cargo commands to manage it.
