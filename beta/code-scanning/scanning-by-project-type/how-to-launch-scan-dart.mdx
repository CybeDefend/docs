**Dart** and **Flutter** projects use a `pubspec.lock` file to pin exact dependency versions. CybeDefend leverages this file to accurately detect vulnerabilities in your Dart packages.

## Recommended Steps

1. **Generate pubspec.lock**  
   Run one of these commands in your project directory:
   ```bash
   # For Dart projects
   dart pub get
   
   # For Flutter projects
   flutter pub get
   ```
   
   This will download your dependencies and generate a `pubspec.lock` file.

2. **Commit pubspec.lock to Your Repository**  
   Always commit the `pubspec.lock` file to ensure all developers and CI systems use identical dependencies.

3. **Keep pubspec.lock Updated**  
   When you update dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml`, regenerate the lockfile with:
   ```bash
   # For Dart projects
   dart pub upgrade
   
   # For Flutter projects
   flutter pub upgrade
   
   # To update a specific package
   dart pub upgrade package_name
   # or
   flutter pub upgrade package_name
   ```

## Understanding pubspec.lock

The `pubspec.lock` file contains a snapshot of all your project's dependencies with their exact versions. This ensures:

- Reproducible builds across environments
- Protection against unexpected dependency changes
- More accurate security scanning by CybeDefend

## Supported Files for Dart/Flutter

| File Examples      |
|-------------------|
| `pubspec.yaml`, `pubspec.lock` |

<Note>
Without a <code>pubspec.lock</code> file, CybeDefend's SCA scanner can only use version constraints from <code>pubspec.yaml</code>, which may not accurately represent the actual dependencies used in your build.
</Note>

<Warning>
Never edit <code>pubspec.lock</code> manually. Always use Dart or Flutter commands to manage it.
</Warning>

<Tip>
For Flutter projects with multiple platforms, make sure to run <code>flutter pub get</code> after adding platform-specific dependencies to ensure the lockfile captures all necessary dependencies.
