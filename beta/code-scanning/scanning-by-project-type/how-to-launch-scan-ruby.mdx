**Ruby** projects managed with Bundler use a `Gemfile.lock` file to pin exact dependency versions. CybeDefend leverages this file to accurately detect vulnerabilities in your Ruby gems.

## Recommended Steps

1. **Generate Gemfile.lock**  
   Run one of these commands in your project directory:
   ```bash
   # Standard installation and lockfile generation
   bundle install
   
   # If you just want to generate the lockfile without installing
   bundle lock
   
   # If you encounter platform issues
   bundle lock --add-platform ruby
   ```

2. **Commit Gemfile.lock to Your Repository**  
   Always commit the `Gemfile.lock` file to ensure all developers and CI systems use identical dependencies.

3. **Keep Gemfile.lock Updated**  
   When you update dependencies in your `Gemfile`, regenerate the lockfile with:
   ```bash
   # Update all dependencies
   bundle update
   
   # Update a specific dependency
   bundle update gem_name
   ```

## Troubleshooting Lockfile Generation

If you encounter issues generating a lockfile, try these approaches:

```bash
# Sometimes specifying a platform helps
bundle lock --add-platform ruby

# If you have ruby version constraints
bundle update --ruby

# For conservative updates
bundle update --conservative
```

## Supported Files for Ruby

| File Examples       |
|--------------------|
| `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock` |

<Note>
Without a <code>Gemfile.lock</code> file, CybeDefend's SCA scanner can only use version constraints from <code>Gemfile</code>, which may not accurately represent the actual dependencies used in your application.
</Note>

<Warning>
Never edit <code>Gemfile.lock</code> manually. Always use Bundler commands to manage it.
</Warning>

<Tip>
If your project has specific Ruby version requirements that cause issues when generating a lockfile, you can temporarily comment out the <code>ruby</code> version line in your Gemfile, generate the lockfile, and then restore the line.
