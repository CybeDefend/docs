**Erlang** projects managed with Rebar3 use a `rebar.lock` file to pin exact dependency versions. CybeDefend leverages this file to accurately detect vulnerabilities in your Erlang dependencies.

## Recommended Steps

1. **Generate rebar.lock**  
   Run the following command in your project directory:
   ```bash
   rebar3 lock
   ```
   
   This will generate a `rebar.lock` file based on the dependencies defined in your `rebar.config`.

2. **Commit rebar.lock to Your Repository**  
   Always commit the `rebar.lock` file to ensure all developers and CI systems use identical dependencies.

3. **Keep rebar.lock Updated**  
   When you update dependencies in your `rebar.config`, regenerate the lockfile with:
   ```bash
   # After updating rebar.config
   rebar3 unlock
   rebar3 lock
   
   # Or to update all dependencies at once
   rebar3 upgrade
   ```

## Understanding rebar.lock

The `rebar.lock` file contains a snapshot of all your project's dependencies with their exact versions and checksums. This ensures:

- Reproducible builds across environments
- Protection against unexpected dependency changes
- More accurate security scanning

## Supported Files for Erlang

| File Examples      |
|-------------------|
| `rebar.config`, `rebar.lock` |

<Note>
Without a <code>rebar.lock</code> file, CybeDefend's SCA scanner can only use version constraints from <code>rebar.config</code>, which may not accurately represent the actual dependencies used in your build.
</Note>

<Warning>
Never edit <code>rebar.lock</code> manually. Always use Rebar3 commands to manage it.
</Warning>

<Tip>
For comprehensive dependency management, combine <code>rebar.lock</code> with <code>rebar3 tree</code> command to visualize your dependency tree and identify any potential security issues.
