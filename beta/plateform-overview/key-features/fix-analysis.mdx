description: "Automatically propose code changes and create pull requests for swift, AI-assisted remediation."

**Fix Analysis** is our upcoming feature designed to **auto-generate** code fixes for identified vulnerabilities and open a **pull request** with a single click. By leveraging AI to propose changes, we remove a major bottleneck—writing initial patch code manually.

## How It Will Work

1. **Find a Vulnerability**  
   Once a vulnerability is flagged by SAST, IAC, or SCA, look for the **“Auto-Fix”** button.
2. **AI-Generated Solution**  
   The system proposes a code fix based on your existing code style, frameworks, and best practices. 
3. **Pull Request Creation**  
   Review the suggested patch, then let CybeDefend create a PR in your repository for further human validation.

<Accordion icon="question" title="Why a Pull Request?">
  Merging code into production requires caution. A pull request ensures your team can:
  - Review the proposed changes.
  - Check compatibility with your codebase.
  - Run any required tests before final approval.
</Accordion>

## Limitations & Best Practices

- **Human Oversight**: AI suggestions aren’t infallible. Always review for logic, performance, or style preferences.
- **Incremental Rollouts**: During early stages, we’ll pilot the feature with Java, Python, and Node.js repositories first.
- **Security Depth**: Some complex vulnerabilities might require deeper architectural changes that auto-fix can’t handle alone.

<Warning>
This feature is <strong>in development</strong>. Track its progress in our <a href="https://cybedefend.featurebase.app/roadmap">Roadmap</a>—and feel free to suggest improvements if you’re part of our pilot program.
</Warning>

<Tip>
We recommend combining <strong>Fix Analysis</strong> with your CI/CD pipeline for automated tests to verify that proposed fixes don’t introduce regressions.
