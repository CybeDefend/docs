title: "Cross-Analysis of Results"
description: "Correlate vulnerabilities across SAST, IAC, and SCA to identify compounded risks."

Single-lens scanning can overlook critical synergies between code and infrastructure. **Cross-Analysis** correlates vulnerabilities from **SAST**, **IAC**, and **SCA** to reveal **compounded** or **multi-vector** risks.

## Real-World Examples

- **Exposed Database**  
  If your code reveals a SQL injection possibility (SAST) and your infrastructure incorrectly exposes the DB to the internet (IAC), that combined risk is far higher than either alone.
- **Dependency-Driven Attack**  
  A known vulnerable library (SCA) might become a bigger risk if your code doesn’t sanitize user input (SAST), forming an exploit chain.

<Accordion icon="exclamation" title="Why Cross-Analysis Matters">
  Without correlating these findings, teams might fix them in isolation, missing the fact that when combined, they form a severe exploit path.

## Planned Functionality

1. **Unified Risk Score**  
   Group related vulnerabilities across scanners into a single “risk cluster,” with an elevated severity or priority if they intersect dangerously.
2. **Dependency Mapping**  
   Visualize how a misconfiguration in one microservice might impact another, bridging code and environment.
3. **Guided Remediation Paths**  
   Potentially highlighting which single fix—like restricting inbound traffic—could reduce multiple vulnerabilities at once.

<Note>
We’re actively building prototypes for Cross-Analysis. Keep an eye on our <a href="https://cybedefend.featurebase.app/roadmap">Roadmap</a> to see upcoming releases and pilot programs.

<Tip>
Engage your entire DevSecOps chain: SREs, developers, and security leads to coordinate on these correlated vulnerabilities.
