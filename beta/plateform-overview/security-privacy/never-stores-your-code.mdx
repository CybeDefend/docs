title: "Never Stores Your Code"
description: "How CybeDefend secures your code and ensures it is not stored post-analysis."

<Tip>
In short: CybeDefend does not keep your code after the scanning process is complete. We use a container-based workflow for running security checks (SAST, secrets detection, etc.), and once the analysis finishes, all code and containers are securely wiped.
</Tip>

## Temporary Container Approach

When you connect your repository to CybeDefend, we create a **fresh container** to clone and analyze your code. This container is isolated and used only for your specific scan. Once the scan is done:

- The **container is terminated**.
- Any **temporary copies of your code** are destroyed immediately.

## The Process at a Glance

CybeDefend securely clones your repository into an isolated container, performs a vulnerability analysis, extracts only security findings, and completely wipes the container and code once the scan is complete.

## On-Premise Scanner Option (see [Roadmap](https://cybedefend.featurebase.app/roadmap)). 

If you prefer keeping everything in your own environment, you can explore our **on-premise scanning** option (coming soon). This allows the scanning process to run entirely in your infrastructure, with only the results syncing back to the CybeDefend platform.

<Tip>
CybeDefendâ€™s container-based approach ensures that your code remains private, isolated, and unexposed once scanning is complete.
