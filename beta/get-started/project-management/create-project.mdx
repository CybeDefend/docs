CybeDefend projects are the core of your DevSecOps workflow. They allow you to scan your code for vulnerabilities, track your security posture, and collaborate with your team. This guide will show you how to create projects in CybeDefend, whether you’re linking a Git provider or uploading a ZIP file.

## How to Create Projects

Before creating your first project, decide how you want to add your code to CybeDefend:

1. **Recommended: Link a Git Provider**  
   If you haven’t installed the GitHub (or GitLab, Bitbucket) integration yet, go to our [Integration Setup](/static-scanning-code-repository/connect-your-source-code/connect-github) page for instructions.
2. **Alternatively: Upload a ZIP**  
   You can upload your code in a zip file, but this is primarily for quick or offline testing. We strongly recommend connecting a Git repository for the best DevSecOps experience.

### Steps to Create a Project

1. **Home → Create Project**  
   In your organization’s home page, click **Create Project**.

2. **Select Your Method**  
   - **Continue with GitHub (or another Git provider)**: Pick your repository, then assign it to a specific team.

   - **Upload ZIP**: Provide your archive if you haven’t integrated a Git provider or need a short-term solution.

3. **Set Scan Parameters**  
   Adjust scanning frequency, severity levels, and advanced options like **SAST Fast Scan** or **Dataflow AI**. You can see more details in our [Scan Project Parameters](/alpha/code-scanning/scanning-options/scan-parameters) guide.

<Note>
While ZIP uploads can help in unique scenarios or offline testing, connecting a Git repository is the recommended approach for continuous, automated scans.
