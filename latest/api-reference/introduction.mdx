## Welcome

CybeDefend is an advanced API designed for application security analysis. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing users, organizations, and projects. With secure authentication and granular permission management, CybeDefend excels in static, dynamic, and Infrastructure as Code security analyses (SAST, DAST, IaC, etc.).

## Authentication

CybeDefend uses its own identity provider. All API requests require a valid short-lived **JWT Bearer token**.

### How to Obtain an Access Token

The recommended way to obtain a Bearer token for API access is via the **CybeDefend CLI** using a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**:

1. **Create a Personal Access Token** in the CybeDefend web interface under **Profile → Personal Access Tokens**
2. **Authenticate the CLI** with your PAT:
   ```bash
   cybedefend login --pat YOUR_PAT --region eu
   ```
3. The CLI exchanges your PAT for a short-lived access token automatically and prints it, or you can use the CLI directly for scans

**Why the CLI?** The CLI application is the only OAuth client authorized to perform the PAT → access token exchange. IDE extensions (VS Code, JetBrains) use their own browser-based OAuth flow.

### Bearer Token Usage

Once you have a JWT access token, include it in every request:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

Access tokens are short-lived. Use the CLI or your IDE extension to refresh them automatically.

### API Key — Deprecated

<Warning>
**API Keys are fully deprecated and no longer functional.** The `X-API-Key` header and all API key-based authentication have been removed. Please migrate to Personal Access Tokens (PAT) as described above.
