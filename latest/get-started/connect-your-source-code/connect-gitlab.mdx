To begin performing **static code scans** on your GitLab repositories with CybeDefend, you'll need to **authorize** and **install** our GitLab integration. Once installed, your repositories will be accessible when creating new projects in CybeDefend.

   Within that section, choose the **GitLab** option for installation instructions.
3. **Click "Install & Authorize"**

## 2. Install & Authorize CybeDefend on GitLab

When GitLab prompts you to authorize **CybeDefend**:

1. **Choose Repositories**  
   Select either all or specific repositories to grant CybeDefend read access.  
2. **Confirm Permissions**  
   We need at least read access for scanning. Write access is optional but enables advanced features like **Auto-Fix Merge Requests**.
3. **Complete Installation**  
   Wait a few seconds for GitLab to finalize authorization.

<Tip>
If you have organizational policies restricting third-party integrations, contact your GitLab Admin to approve CybeDefend's access.
</Tip>

## 3. Linking Repositories to Your Projects

After installation, you can associate any authorized repository with a **new project** in CybeDefend:

- **Go to "Create Project"**: Navigate to [Create Project](/latest/get-started/project-management/create-project).  
- **Select "Continue with GitLab"**: Your authorized repos will appear in a dropdown.  
- **Choose Your Repo**: Pick a repository, assign it to a team, and configure scanning parameters.

<Note>
If you just installed the integration, it may take a few moments before your repositories become visible in the "Create Project" flow.
