This guide shows you how to run **CybeDefend local scans** within a **GitLab Self-Managed** environment. It’s ideal if you want to keep your code in-house and still benefit from automated security checks.

## Prerequisites

1. **API Key**  
   Ensure you’ve already created an API key in the CybeDefend dashboard. If not, see [Introduction & API Key Creation](/latest/code-scanning/local-code-scanning/introduction-api-key).
2. **CybeDefend CLI**  
   You can either install the CLI directly in your job container or use a Docker image containing the CLI.

<Note>
The <strong>--ci</strong> flag in CybeDefend’s CLI disables colors and fancy formatting, providing minimal, script-friendly output. 
</Note>

## Example .gitlab-ci.yml

```yaml
stages:
  - security-scan

security_scan_job:
  image: ubuntu:latest
  stage: security-scan
  script:
    - apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
    - curl -L https://github.com/CybeDefend/cybedefend-cli/releases/download/v1.0.0/cybedefend-linux-amd64 -o cybedefend
    - chmod +x cybedefend
    - mv cybedefend /usr/local/bin/
    - cybedefend scan --dir . --ci --api-key $CYBEDEFEND_API_KEY --project-id $CYBEDEFEND_PROJECT_ID
  only:
    - main
```

### Key Points

- **Use the “security-scan” stage** or any custom stage relevant to your pipeline.  
- **Install CLI**: Basic `curl` commands to grab the binary.  
- **Run the scan**: Provide `--dir .` to scan current working directory.  
- **Env Variables**: `$CYBEDEFEND_API_KEY` and `$CYBEDEFEND_PROJECT_ID` are stored in GitLab’s CI/CD Variables.

<Accordion icon="alert-triangle" title="Using Docker Instead">
  <p>If you prefer Docker-based scanning, create or pull an image with <strong>cybedefend</strong> pre-installed, then run the scan inside a container in your pipeline.</p>
</Accordion>

## Viewing Results

After the job completes, you can:

- **Check the CLI output** for immediate details.  
- **Use the CLI ‘results’ command** to fetch a more comprehensive vulnerability listing:
  ```bash
  cybedefend results --project-id $CYBEDEFEND_PROJECT_ID --all --output html
  ```
- **Visit CybeDefend Dashboard** to see a full breakdown of vulnerabilities found during each pipeline run.

<Tip>
For large codebases, consider caching dependencies to speed up builds – your security scans will remain unaffected as long as you keep scanning the final code or artifact.
