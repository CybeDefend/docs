A **Personal Access Token (PAT)** lets you authenticate the CybeDefend CLI without going through the browser. It is the recommended authentication method for CI/CD pipelines and scripted environments.

---

## Create a Personal Access Token

1. Log in to the CybeDefend web interface
2. Navigate to **Profile → Personal Access Tokens**
3. Click **+ Create New Token**, give it a name (e.g., "CLI Token")
4. Copy and store the token securely — it is shown only once

<Note>
Store your PAT in a secure secrets manager or as an encrypted CI/CD secret. Never commit it to source control.
</Note>

---

## Authenticate the CLI with Your PAT

```bash
cybedefend login --pat YOUR_PAT --region eu
```

Your credentials are saved to `~/.cybedefend/credentials.json`. Subsequent commands (scan, results…) use them automatically — no need to pass `--pat` every time.

<Tip>
Once logged in, the `--region` flag is remembered automatically. You can simply run `cybedefend scan --dir .` for all future commands.
</Tip>

---

## Authenticate via OAuth (interactive)

For local development, you can also log in through your browser:

```bash
cybedefend login --region eu
```

This opens the CybeDefend login page in your default browser. After completing authentication, the CLI stores your session automatically. Access tokens are refreshed transparently when they expire.

---

## Use a PAT Without Logging In

For CI/CD environments where persistent sessions are not practical, you can pass the PAT directly via environment variable — no `cybedefend login` step needed:

```bash
export CYBEDEFEND_PAT=your_pat_here
cybedefend scan --dir . --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

Or inline for a single command:

```bash
CYBEDEFEND_PAT=${{ secrets.CYBEDEFEND_PAT }} cybedefend scan --dir . --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

## Credential Priority Order

When running any command, credentials are resolved in this order:

1. `--pat` flag (highest priority)
2. `CYBEDEFEND_PAT` environment variable
3. `pat` field in config file (`config.yml`)
4. Stored credentials from `cybedefend login`

## Logout

```bash
cybedefend logout
```

Deletes `~/.cybedefend/credentials.json` and clears the stored session.
