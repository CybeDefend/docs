CybeDefend offers a **flexible, usage-based pricing model** tailored to your organization's needs. Our subscriptions provide a package of **Cybe AI agent requests** and platform features, with the ability to add more credits as needed.

## How Our Pricing Works

### Organization-Wide Credit Pool

CybeDefend's pricing is designed around **organization-level credit allocation**, not individual users:

- **Credits are shared across your entire organization**
- **No per-user tracking** — one developer can use more credits than another without penalty
- **Flexible usage** — credits are pooled for all team members to draw from as needed

<Info>
This means if one developer uses 1,000 Cybe AI requests and another uses 100, it doesn't matter—both draw from the same organizational credit pool.
</Info>

### Add-On Credits

When your organization needs more Cybe AI requests:

- **Purchase additional credit packages** on-demand
- **No subscription changes required** — simply add credits as needed
- **Credits remain at the organization level** — shared by all members

<Note>
Add-ons provide flexibility to scale your AI-powered analysis capabilities without upgrading your entire subscription.
