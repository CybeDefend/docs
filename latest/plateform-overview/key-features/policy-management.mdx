## Overview

The **Policy Management** feature provides a **Policy as Code** approach to security governance. Define your security requirements in YAML or JSON, and CybeDefend will automatically evaluate every scan against your policies.

## Key Features

### Policy Hierarchy

Policies are applied in a hierarchical manner, ensuring organizational standards cannot be bypassed:

```
Organization Policy (highest priority)
    ↓
Team Policy
    ↓
Project Policy (lowest priority)
```

<Info>
A policy at a higher level **cannot be disabled** by a policy at a lower level. Lower-level policies can only **add stricter rules**.
</Info>

### Automatic Vulnerability Filtering

During policy evaluation, certain vulnerabilities are automatically ignored to focus on active security risks:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `not_exploitable` | Manually reviewed and marked as not posing a security risk |
| `resolved` / `fixed` | Already fixed in the source code |
| `ignored` / `accepted_risk` | Risks that have been formally accepted by the organization |

---

## Policy Configuration

Policies are defined in YAML format with complete metadata. Here's a full example:

```yaml
version: '1.0'
name: 'Production Security Policy'
description: 'Strict security policy for production deployments'
scope: PROJECT  # ORGANIZATION | TEAM | PROJECT
priority: 10    # 1-100 (lower = higher priority)
enabled: true

# For PROJECT scope - specify target projects
projectIds:
  - 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001

rules:
  - name: 'Block critical vulnerabilities'
    type: severity
    operator: eq
    value: CRITICAL
    action: block

  - name: 'Warn on high vulnerabilities'
    type: severity
    operator: eq
    value: HIGH
    action: warn

  - name: 'Block high CVSS scores'
    type: cvss_score
    operator: gt
    value: 9.0
    action: block

# Optional exclusions (max 30)
exclusions:
  - pattern: 'test/**'
    reason: 'Test files are not deployed to production'
  
  - pattern: '**/vendor/**'
    reason: 'Third-party code - tracked separately'
    expirationDate: '2026-06-30T00:00:00Z'
```

<Note>
Policies require **1-15 rules** and support a **maximum of 30 exclusions**.
</Note>

---

## Rule Types

| Type | Description | Valid Values |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `severity` | Vulnerability severity level | `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info` |
| `cvss_score` | CVSS score (0-10) | Numeric value (e.g., `7.5`, `9.0`) |
| `cwe_check` | CWE identifier | String (e.g., `CWE-89`, `CWE-79`) |
| `owasp_category` | OWASP Top 10 category | String (e.g., `A01:2021`, `A03:2021`) |
| `scanner_type` | Type of scanner | `sast`, `secret`, `sca`, `container`, `iac`, `cicd` |
| `vulnerability_age_days` | Days since detection | Numeric value |
| `is_new_vulnerability` | Whether vulnerability is new | Boolean (`true`/`false`) |
| `branch` | Git branch name (supports glob) | String (e.g., `main`, `feature/*`) |
| `composite_and` | Combine rules with AND logic | Array of sub-rules |
| `composite_or` | Combine rules with OR logic | Array of sub-rules |

---

## Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `eq` | Equals (exact match) | `severity eq critical` |
| `neq` | Not equals | `severity neq info` |
| `gt` | Greater than | `cvss_score gt 7.0` |
| `lt` | Less than | `vulnerability_age_days lt 30` |
| `gte` | Greater than or equal | `cvss_score gte 9.0` |
| `lte` | Less than or equal | `vulnerability_age_days lte 7` |
| `in` | In list | `severity in [critical, high]` |
| `not_in` | Not in list | `cwe_check not_in [CWE-1, CWE-2]` |

---

## Actions

| Action | Description | CI/CD Exit Code |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `block` | Blocks the pipeline, creates violation record | `1` |
| `warn` | Creates violation record, doesn't block | `0` |

---

## Composite Rules

Use composite rules to combine multiple conditions:

### AND Logic (All conditions must match)

```yaml
- name: 'Block Critical on Main Branch'
  type: composite_and
  action: block
  criteria:
    - type: severity
      operator: eq
      value: CRITICAL
    - type: branch
      operator: eq
      value: main
```

### OR Logic (Any condition can match)

```yaml
- name: 'Block dangerous patterns'
  type: composite_or
  action: block
  criteria:
    - type: cvss_score
      operator: gt
      value: 9.0
    - type: cwe_check
      operator: in
      value: ['CWE-89', 'CWE-78', 'CWE-94']
```

---

## Exclusions

Exclusions allow you to skip policy evaluation for specific files or patterns:

```yaml
exclusions:
  - pattern: 'test/**'
    reason: 'Test files are not deployed'  # Required

  - pattern: '**/node_modules/**'
    reason: 'Dependencies tracked via SCA'
    expirationDate: '2026-12-31T00:00:00Z'  # Optional expiration
```

**Pattern matching uses glob patterns:**
- `**` matches any number of directories
- `*` matches any characters except `/`
- `?` matches a single character

<Warning>
Always set expiration dates on exclusions to prevent permanent security gaps.
</Warning>

name: Security Check

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run CybeDefend Scan
        run: cybedefend scan --all

      - name: Evaluate Policies
        env:
          CYBEDEFEND_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYBEDEFEND_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          # Trigger policy evaluation
          RESULT=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $CYBEDEFEND_API_KEY" \
            "$CYBEDEFEND_API/scans/$SCAN_ID/compliance")

          exit $EXIT_CODE
```

### GitLab CI

```yaml
security-check:
  stage: test
  script:
    - cybedefend scan --all
    - cybedefend check-compliance --scan-id $SCAN_ID --exit-on-failure
  artifacts:
    reports:
      security: security-report.json
```

## Managing Violations

When a policy violation occurs, you have two options to resolve it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Change Vulnerability Status">
    Change the vulnerability status from "open" to "ignored" with a justification. The vulnerability will be excluded from future policy evaluations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fix the Vulnerability">
    Resolve the security issue directly in your source code and re-run the scan. The vulnerability will be marked as "resolved" and excluded from policy evaluations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Both approaches create an audit trail. Changing status to "ignored" requires a comment explaining the risk acceptance decision.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Warning-Only Mode">
    When rolling out policies, start with `action: warn` to understand the impact before switching to `action: block`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Expiring Exclusions">
    Always set expiration dates on exclusions to prevent permanent security gaps:
    ```yaml
    exclusions:
      - pattern: 'src/legacy/**'
        reason: 'Technical debt - scheduled for Q2 refactor'
        expirationDate: '2026-06-30T00:00:00Z'
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Layer Policies Appropriately">
    - **Organization level**: Global security requirements (e.g., no exposed secrets)
    - **Team level**: Team-specific standards (e.g., frontend vs backend rules)
    - **Project level**: Project-specific exclusions only
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Version Control Your Policies">
    Store policy YAML files in your repository:
    ```
    repo/
    ├── .cybedefend/
    │   ├── policies/
    │   │   ├── sast-policy.yaml
    │   │   ├── sca-policy.yaml
    │   │   └── secret-policy.yaml
    │   └── README.md
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
