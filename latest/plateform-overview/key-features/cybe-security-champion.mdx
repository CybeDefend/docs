Doesn't just fix problems—it educates. Each interaction includes explanations of security principles, helping developers understand why vulnerabilities occur and how to prevent them in future code.

### Project-Specific Insights

By analyzing your entire project through our proprietary parsing system, provides insights specific to your application's architecture, dependencies, and security posture.

## Understanding Security Champions

In traditional organizations, a **Security Champion** is a designated expert—typically a senior developer with security expertise—who serves as the bridge between development teams and security departments. However, this model faces challenges:

- **Limited Availability**: One person covering multiple teams means waiting times
- **Knowledge Bottlenecks**: Development slows when the Security Champion is unavailable
- **Scaling Issues**: Growing organizations struggle to maintain recommended ratios
- **Inconsistent Coverage**: Time zones and working hours create gaps

**Cybe Security Champion** solves these challenges by providing every developer with their own dedicated security expert, available instantly, 24/7, with comprehensive knowledge of your entire codebase.
