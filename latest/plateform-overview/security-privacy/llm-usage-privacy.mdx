description: "How CybeDefend uses sovereign LLMs with strict privacy guarantees."
---

CybeDefend leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to power our AI agents while maintaining the highest standards of data privacy and security.

---

## Our LLM Policy

### Sovereign LLM Infrastructure

All LLMs used by CybeDefend are deployed on **sovereign cloud infrastructure** within your chosen region (EU or US). Your code and vulnerability data never leave your selected geographical boundary.

### No Training or Fine-Tuning

<Warning>
**CybeDefend has a strict zero-training policy**: Your code, vulnerabilities, and interactions with our AI agents are **never used** for training, fine-tuning, or improving our models.
</Warning>

This policy ensures:

- **Complete confidentiality**: Your proprietary code remains private
- **No data leakage**: Your security findings never contribute to model training
- **Compliance**: Meets the strictest regulatory requirements (GDPR, SOC 2, etc.)

---

## Data Processing

When you use CybeDefend AI features (Cybe Analysis, Cybe AutoFix, Cybe Security Champion):

1. **Your code is parsed** into our proprietary knowledge graph
2. **Queries are sent** to sovereign LLMs within your chosen region
3. **Responses are generated** using your specific codebase context
4. **All data remains** within your regional boundary

<Info>
LLM inference happens in real-time and is not persisted beyond the immediate request/response cycle.
</Info>

## Regional LLM Deployment

| Region | LLM Location | Compliance |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Europe** | EU sovereign cloud | GDPR, ANSSI SecNumCloud, BSI C5 |
| **United States** | US cloud infrastructure | SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS |

---

## Your Control

You can enable or disable AI features at the project level:

- **Cybe Analysis**: Can be toggled in project settings
- **Cybe AutoFix**: Requires explicit activation and Git integration
- **Cybe Security Champion**: Requires Cybe Analysis to be enabled

When AI features are disabled, no code is sent to LLMs.
