By default, CybeDefend can scan GitHub repos in the cloud. If you prefer **not** to grant direct GitHub access, you can run local scans in your **GitHub Actions** pipeline, uploading code to CybeDefend yourself.

## Prerequisites

- **API Key**: [Create and store](/static-scanning-code-repository/local-code-scanning/introduction-api-key) it in **Settings → Secrets** → **Actions** (e.g., `CYBEDEFEND_API_KEY`).
- **Project ID**: You can also store it as `CYBEDEFEND_PROJECT_ID` secret.

## Example .github/workflows/cybedefend-scan.yml

```yaml
name: CybeDefend Local Scan
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  local_security_scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install CybeDefend CLI
        run: |
          curl -L https://github.com/CybeDefend/cybedefend-cli/releases/download/v1.0.0/cybedefend-linux-amd64 -o cybedefend
          chmod +x cybedefend
          sudo mv cybedefend /usr/local/bin/

      - name: Run security scan
        run: cybedefend scan --dir ./ --ci \
          --api-key ${{ secrets.CYBEDEFEND_API_KEY }} \
          --project-id ${{ secrets.CYBEDEFEND_PROJECT_ID }}
```

### Explanation

1. **Branch Filter**  
   Only runs on `main` to avoid mixing partial results in other branches.  
2. **CLI Download**  
   Uses cURL to get the binary from GitHub Releases.  
3. **Local Scan**  
   The code is zipped and uploaded to CybeDefend’s servers for analysis.

  <p>Alternatively, run a Docker image containing the CLI. This can simplify scanning if you prefer pinned container versions and dependencies.</p>

## Checking Your Results

- **Action Logs**: The job logs show a brief summary of vulnerabilities discovered.
- **CLI “results”**: Add a step to fetch results in, say, HTML or SARIF:
  ```yaml
  - name: Fetch Detailed Results
    run: |
      cybedefend results --project-id ${{ secrets.CYBEDEFEND_PROJECT_ID }} --all --output sarif
  ```
- **CybeDefend Dashboard**: Full vulnerability details and historical tracking.

<Tip>
Restrict scanning to your main or dev branch. Use <strong>feature branch scans</strong> if you want to catch new issues before merging.
