Use **Bitbucket Pipelines** to automate local scanning with the CybeDefend CLI. This approach is ideal if you want to keep direct repository access closed and rely on your pipeline to handle code uploads.

## Prerequisites

- **API Key**: [Create it](/static-scanning-code-repository/local-code-scanning/introduction-api-key) and store in Bitbucket’s **Repository Settings → Pipelines → Repository Variables**.
- **Bitbucket Pipelines**: Enable pipelines in your repository.

---

## Example bitbucket-pipelines.yml

```yaml
image: ubuntu:latest

pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: CybeDefend Local Scan
        caches:
          - apt
        script:
          - apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
          - curl -L https://github.com/CybeDefend/cybedefend-cli/releases/download/v1.0.0/cybedefend-linux-amd64 -o cybedefend
          - chmod +x cybedefend
          - mv cybedefend /usr/local/bin/
          - cybedefend scan --dir . --ci --api-key $CYBEDEFEND_API_KEY --project-id $CYBEDEFEND_PROJECT_ID
```

### Explanation

1. **image**  
   `ubuntu:latest` is sufficient for installing cURL and the CLI.  
2. **Install CLI**  
   Similar approach as other platforms.  
3. **Run the Scan**  
   Use environment variables `$CYBEDEFEND_API_KEY` and `$CYBEDEFEND_PROJECT_ID` defined in Bitbucket’s pipeline settings.

<Note>
You can add advanced steps, such as storing results in artifacts or gating merges based on severity thresholds.

## Where to Check Results

1. **Pipeline Logs**: The CLI’s console output shows a summary.  
2. **Local Results**: Optionally fetch `sarif` or `html` outputs in subsequent steps:
   ```bash
   cybedefend results --project-id $CYBEDEFEND_PROJECT_ID --output html --filename bitbucket-scan.html
   ```
3. **CybeDefend Dashboard**: Provides a deeper analysis of all vulnerabilities discovered.

<Warning>
Bitbucket Pipelines may have build minute limitations. Ensure your scans complete within your pipeline’s allotted time.
</Warning>

<Tip>
For huge codebases, consider partial scans or <strong>artifact caching</strong> to reduce pipeline duration.
