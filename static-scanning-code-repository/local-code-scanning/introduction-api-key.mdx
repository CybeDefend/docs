The **CybeDefend CLI** allows you to run **local code scans** on your machine or in any CI environment. By uploading your code (or zipped directory) to CybeDefend, you receive immediate vulnerability insights—mirroring our cloud-based scanning, but on your terms.

## Why Use Local Code Scanning?

- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate scans into your pipeline to catch issues before merging.
- **Single-Command Simplicity**: The CLI provides direct control—no complex configuration needed beyond an API key.

## API Key Creation Tutorial

To authenticate your CLI scans, you’ll need a **CybeDefend API key**:

1. **Go to Profile → API Key**  
   In the CybeDefend web interface, click your user profile and select **API Key**.  
2. **Create New Key**  
   Click **+ Create New API Key**. Provide a name (e.g., “Local Scanner Key”).  
3. **Copy & Store Securely**  
   The key is shown once. Copy and keep it safe—like in an environment variable or a secrets manager.

<Note>
You can revoke or regenerate API keys anytime if you suspect they’re compromised.

## Next Steps

- **Learn the CLI Options**: Head to [CLI Options for Local Scanner](/static-scanning-code-repository/local-code-scanning/cli-options) for usage details.
- **Install for Your OS**: Follow the OS-specific tutorials ([Mac Setup](/static-scanning-code-repository/local-code-scanning/mac-setup), [Windows Setup](/static-scanning-code-repository/local-code-scanning/windows-setup), [Linux Setup](/static-scanning-code-repository/local-code-scanning/linux-setup)) to get started.
- **Scan & View Results**: After installing, run a local scan, then retrieve results directly in your terminal or through the CybeDefend dashboard.
