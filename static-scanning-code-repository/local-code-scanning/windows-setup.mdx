## Installation Steps

1. **Download**  
   Grab `cybedefend-windows-amd64.exe` (64-bit) or `cybedefend-windows-386.exe` (32-bit) from [Releases](https://github.com/CybeDefend/cybedefend-cli/releases).
2. **Rename (Optional)**  
   Rename to `cybedefend.exe` for easier usage.
3. **Add to PATH**  
   Place it in a folder included in your PATH, or just call it from its current location.
