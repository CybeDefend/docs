Cybdefend FAQs
 -Some Main Questions 
 
2) Getting Started
A) General Information
- Cybedefend never stores your code
- Cybedefend Security Checks (Checks static scan, container, Cloud, Domain DAST, Security By Design BLSA)
- SAST, IAC and SCA by Cybedefend: supported languages, security focus and scanner
	IAC : Cybdefend Engine + checkov, trivy, Kicks
	SAST : Cybdefend Engine + Semgrep, Bearer
	SCA : Cybdefend Engine + Github adisories
- Reachability engine to remove false positives with AI (see roadmap)
	Using or not the vulnerability detected function or package
- Dataflow to follow the vulnerability in your code (Alpha)
- RBAC/Rebac management Organization, Teams, Project and Users (advanced segmentation and choice)
- Parameters Start Scan project 
	Frequencies Scanning
	Vulnerability severity choice
	Type of scanning (recommended everyone)
	Sast fast scaninng and Datafflow option
- Free plan to test on your project And Demonstration planfication
	How On Boarding is plannified : 
		- Kick Off presentation and demonstration (If you require a signed NDA, we can provide one to you (or review your own to sign))
		- Support (In-app support, Slack/Teams, Dev Docs)
		- Evaluation Form to helps us improve 
			- Ease of use & setup
			- Capabilities (meet requirements, are the features and integrations sufficient, is ai integration help you in your process to improve focus and prioritisation compared to others you've seen),
			- Comparisons (pricing, features comprared to other stack provider, does ai make the difference ?)
			- Support (reactive, response time quality, does your team trust Cybdefend)
			- Costs & ROI (good proce in return of ROI, reduce dev time on security issue and better understanding easiier thanks to ai ?)

B) On-boarding and Account Creation and management
- Create Account, your Organization and Connect Your Repositories 
	- Create an acocunt only with Oauth2
	- Detail : As soon as you have done account setup and connected repositories, Cybdefend will instantly start a scan
	- redirection Detailed Integration Guides
- Managing access with Organizations and Teams
	- Each organization has member roles and Teams and each Teams has members, roles and Project (whitch is the code based)
	- How To Create Teams
	- How To Create Projects
	- How invite organizations member
	- How to invite Teams member
	- How to select your team in UI
- Assigning Roles in Organizations and Teams
	- Presentation of roles and accessibility for team member and organization member (Table comparaison)
	- Roles and Permissions for Organization members
	- Roles and Permissionsfor Team members
	- How to modify Team adn organization roles (In an organization it needs to have one administrator and in a team a team manager and administrator and team manager can not modify their own roles and between each other) 
- GitHub Integration for Authentication and User Management

C) Relevant Functionnalities
- Page Project Management with main statistics and project list with vulnerability by severity.
- For each Project List of vulnerability class by type of scanner + different filter to present
- Security Champion directly integrates in dashboard with understanding f the context of the vulnerability
- Update any vulnerability easily (severity, risk and add comment to follow up the progress)
- Overview project page (main statics on the proejct vulneraiblity by type, by time, by scanner type ect...)
- Fix analysis : correct any issue and create a pull request (with a human validation) with ai
- AI-Powered Vulnerabulity Detection (in Developmement see roadmap) : Reduction of false positive and false negativeon scanner SAST and IAC
- Cross-Analysis of Results : Correlates findings across different analysis types, identifying patterns and dependencies that could increase or decrease risk.
- AI Intelligent Vulnerability Triage : Sort vulnerabilities based on exploitability, availability and relevance to the application for focus on the most critical issues first.
- Innovation BLSA (in Developmement see roadmap): New Product to find inserue by design issue in a repository 

3) Static Scanning Code Repository
A) Connect Your Source Code
	- Connect GitHub Account to Cybedefend
		First link Organization in integration setting (few minutes to set up)
		Then create project with github 
		Select the repository and click on create (start scan launch and immediate results)
	- More to come see roadmap
B) Scanning a project with Cybedefend - Good Practice
	- SCA specifications (Support for dependency scanning by language)
		Array Language, File Scanned, zero day vulneraibility analysis (CRON Task)
	- Maven, C/C++,.NET, Java/Scala/Kotlin to take and modify from Aikido documentaiton
	- Scanned Branches in Cybedefend : Single-Branch Scanning only the master branch
C) Local Code Scanning
	- Introduction + Api Key creation tuotorial and redirection to article local scaning for Linux/MAc/Windows
	- CLI options for Local Scanner + Documentation from github cli repository + specific command
	- Mac Setup for Local Code Scanning : Requirements, How to set up Local Scanning
	- Windows Setup for Local Code Scanning : Requirements, How to set up Local Scanning
	- Linux Setup for Local Code Scanning : Requirements, How to set up Local Scanning
D) Autres
	- Why does Cybedefend not find a specific vulnerability or CVE inside a dependency?
	
4) CI Integrations
	- GitLab Self Managed Setup for Local Code Scanning Tutorial (documentaiton example)
	- Azure DevOps Server Setup for Local Code Scanning Tutorial (documentaiton example)
	- GitHub Action Setup for Local Code Scanning Tutorial (documentaiton example)

5) Cybedefend Autofix
A) AI Autofix for SAST and IaC Issues
	- Key Features of AI Autofix
	- Important Info (We do not use your code for training / fine-tuning, Speed,Confidence Levels)
	- How to use the AI Autofix functionality (in developpement see roadmap)
